As an increasing number of suicide attacks rock Pakistan's major cities, concerns for the country's security are 
rising. In recent years, many new terrorist groups have emerged, several existing groups have reconstituted 
themselves, and a new crop of militants has emerged, more violent and less conducive to political solutions 
than their predecessors. Links between many of these new and existing groups have strengthened, say experts, 
giving rise to fresh concerns for stability. A failed bombing attempt in New York's Times Square in May 2010 
with links to Pakistan also exposes the growing ambitions of many of these groups that had previously focused 
only on the region. The Pakistan-born U.S. citizen Faisal Shahzad who confessed to the bombing attempt was 
sentenced to life imprisonment by a U.S. court in October 2010.
Pakistani authorities have long had ties to militant groups based on their soil that largely focused their efforts 
in Afghanistan and India. But with Pakistan joining the United States as an ally in its "war on terrorism" since 
9/11, experts say Islamabad has seen harsh blowback on its policy of backing militants operating abroad. 
Leadership elements of al-Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban, along with other terrorist groups, have made 
Pakistan's tribal areas (the semi-autonomous region along the Afghan border) their home and now work 
closely with a wide variety of Pakistani militant groups. On May 1, 2011, al-Qaeda leader and 9/11 mastermind 
Osama bin Laden was killed by a U.S. raid in Abbottabad, a military town not far from Islamabad, raising 
questions about the Pakistani government and intelligence services' knowledge of his whereabouts.
