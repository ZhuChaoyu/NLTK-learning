References to persons shall include corporations. Any reference in this Prospectus and the Application Forms to any statute or enactment is a reference to that statute or enactment for the time being amended or re-enacted. Any word de®ned under the Singapore Companies Act or the Bermuda Act or any statutory modi®cation thereof and used in this Prospectus and the Application Forms shall have the meaning assigned to it under the Singapore Companies Act or the Bermuda Act or such statutory modi®cation, as the case may be. Any reference in this Prospectus or the Application Forms to Shares being allotted to an applicant includes allotment to CDP for the account of that applicant.

Our Company has such power to purchase its own Shares under paragraph (h) of the schedule referred to in Clause 7 of our Memorandum of Association. Such power of our Company to purchase its own Shares shall, subject to the Bermuda Act and our Memorandum of Association and Bye-Law 7 of the Bye-Laws and, where applicable, the rules and/or prior approval of the SGX-ST and/or any competent regulatory authority (as de®ned in the Bermuda Act), be exercisable by our Directors upon such terms and subject to such conditions as they may think ®t. Under the laws of Bermuda, such purchases may be effected out of the capital paid-up on the purchased Shares or out of the funds of our Company otherwise available for dividend or distribution or out of proceeds of a fresh issue of Shares made for that purpose. Any premium payable on such a purchase over the par value of the Shares to be purchased must be provided for out of the funds of our Company otherwise available for dividend or distribution or out of our Company's share premium account. Any amount due to a shareholder on a purchase by a company of its own shares may (i) be paid in cash, (ii) be satis®ed by the transfer of any part of the undertaking or property of the company having the same value or (iii) be satis®ed partly under (i) and partly under (ii). The Bermuda Act also provides that no purchase by us of our own Shares may be effected if, on the date on which the purchase is to be effected there are reasonable grounds for believing that we are, or after the purchase would be, unable to pay our liabilities as they become due. The Shares so purchased will be treated as cancelled and our Company's issued capital, but not its authorised capital, will be diminished accordingly. For further details, please refer to paragraph 4 in the section under the heading ``Purchase by the company of its own shares and warrants'' of ``Annex B Ð Summary of Bermuda Company Law'' on page B-2 of this Prospectus. At present, we have no intention to purchase our Shares after our listing on the SGX-ST. However, if we decide to do so later, we would seek our Shareholders' approval in accordance with the laws of Bermuda and the rules of the SGX-ST. We will make prompt public announcements of any such share purchase and have also given an undertaking to the SGX-ST to comply with all requirements that the SGX-ST may impose in the event of such share purchase. 10 PURCHASE BY A COMPANY OF ITS OWN SHARES Our Company is incorporated in Bermuda and operates subject to Bermuda law. Bermuda law recognises only the registered shareholders of a Bermuda-incorporated company and as such, persons holding shares in the capital of a Bermuda-incorporated company through CDP would not be recognised as shareholders of such company. Consequently, such persons would not have a right to attend and to vote at general meetings convened by such company. In order for such persons to attend and vote at general meetings, CDP would normally appoint such persons as their proxies to attend and vote at such meetings. The proxy form appointing such persons as the proxies of CDP would be enclosed with the document to be sent containing a notice convening such general meeting. Such proxy form would be required to be completed and deposited within the time frame stipulated in the document, in order for such person to attend and vote at the general meeting. 11 ATTENDANCE AT GENERAL MEETINGS There are presently no requirements under any Bermuda laws or regulations on takeover offers for our Shares which would be applicable to us. In addition, Sections 213, 214 and 215 of the Singapore Companies Act, the Tenth Schedule to the Singapore Companies Act and the Singapore Code of Take-overs and Mergers (1985 Edition) (collectively the ``Singapore Takeover and Merger Laws and Regulations'') apply only to takeover offers for public companies incorporated in Singapore and not to companies incorporated outside Singapore. As our Company is incorporated in Bermuda, the Singapore Takeover and Merger Laws and Regulations do not apply to takeover offers for our Company. Bye-Law 193 (as described below) will, due to its binding effect on our Members, require our Members who make takeover offers in respect of our Shares to comply with the Singapore Takeover and Merger Laws and Regulations. However, it is uncertain whether this can be implemented in practice. As Bye-Law 193 only binds our Members, a person (including a corporation) who is not our Member will not be bound to comply with the Singapore Takeover and Merger Laws and Regulations. Bye-Law 193 provides that for so long as the Shares are listed on the Designated Stock Exchange (as de®ned in the Bye-Laws), the Singapore Takeover and Merger Laws and Regulations, including any amendments, modi®cations, revisions, variations or re-enactments thereof, shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to all takeover offers for our Company. Our substantial Shareholders, Wong's Brothers Consortium Inc and Snappy Performance Ltd, have each undertaken to the SGX-ST that, as long as they continue to be the substantial Shareholders, they will endeavour to persuade potential offerors in connection with a takeover offer for our Company to comply with the requirements of the Singapore Takeover and Merger Laws and Regulations in the event of any takeover offers for our Company. 12 TAKEOVERS This Prospectus does not constitute an offer, solicitation or invitation to subscribe for and/or purchase our Shares in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or invitation is unlawful or is not authorised or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer, solicitation or invitation. No action has been or will be taken under the requirements of the legislation or regulations of, or of the legal or regulatory authorities of, any jurisdiction, except for the ®ling and/or registration of this Prospectus in Bermuda and Singapore in order to permit a public offering of our Shares and the public distribution of this Prospectus in Singapore. The distribution of this Prospectus and the offering of our Shares in certain jurisdictions may be restricted by the relevant laws in such jurisdictions. Persons who may come into possession of this Prospectus are required by our Company, the Manager, the Underwriter and the Placement Agent to inform themselves of, and to observe and comply with, any such restrictions. 13 SELLING RESTRICTIONS LISTING ON THE SGX-ST We have applied to the SGX-ST for permission to deal in and for quotation of all our Shares already issued, the New Shares which are the subject of the Invitation and the Option Shares. Such permission will be granted when we have been admitted to the Of®cial List of the SGX-ST. Acceptance of applications will be conditional upon the completion of the Invitation, which is subject to the SGX-ST granting permission to deal in and for quotation of all of our issued Shares and the New Shares. If the said permission is not granted, monies paid in respect of any application accepted will be returned to you at your own risk, without interest or any share of revenue or other bene®t arising therefrom, and you will not have any claim against us or the Manager. The SGX-ST assumes no responsibility for the correctness of any of the statements made, opinions expressed or reports contained in this Prospectus. Admission to the Of®cial List of the SGX-ST is not to be taken as an indication of the merits of the Invitation, our Company, our subsidiaries or our Shares. A copy of this Prospectus, together with copies of the Application Forms, has been lodged with and registered by the Registrar of Companies and Businesses in Singapore who takes no responsibility for its contents. We have ®led a copy of this Prospectus, together with copies of the Application Forms, with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda. The Bermuda Monetary Authority has given its consent to the issue of the New Shares pursuant to the Invitation on the terms referred to in this Prospectus. In granting such consent and in accepting this Prospectus for ®ling, the Bermuda Monetary Authority and the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda accept no responsibility for the ®nancial soundness of our Group or any proposal or for the correctness of any of the statements made or opinions expressed herein or any of the other documents referred to in this Prospectus.

We have not authorised any person to give any information or to make any representation not contained in this Prospectus in connection with the Invitation and, if given or made, such information or representation must not be relied upon as having been authorised by our Company or the Manager. Neither the delivery of this Prospectus and the Application Forms nor the Invitation shall, under any circumstances, constitute a continuing representation or create any suggestion or implication that there has been no change in the affairs of our Company or our Group or any statement of fact or information contained in this Prospectus since the date of this Prospectus. Where such changes occur and are material or are required to be disclosed by law and/or the SGX-ST, we will make an announcement of the same to the SGX-ST and, if required, lodge a supplementary document or replacement document pursuant to Section 50A of the Singapore Companies Act and take immediate steps to comply with the requirements of Section 50A. You should take note of any such announcements and, upon release of such an announcement, shall be deemed to have notice of such changes. Save as expressly stated in this Prospectus, nothing herein is, or may be relied upon as, a promise or representation as to the future performance or policies of our Group. This Prospectus has been prepared solely for the purpose of the Invitation and may not be relied upon by any persons other than by you in connection with your application for the New Shares or for any other purpose. This Prospectus does not constitute an offer, invitation or solicitation to subscribe for the New Shares in any jurisdiction in which such offer, invitation or solicitation is unauthorised or unlawful, nor does it constitute an offer, invitation or solicitation to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer, invitation or solicitation. 14 DETAILS OF THE INVITATION Copies of this Prospectus and the Application Forms may be obtained on request, subject to availability, from:± OVERSEA-CHINESE BANKING CORPORATION LIMITED 65 Chulia Street OCBC Centre Singapore 049513 and from selected branches of OCBC Bank, members of the Association of Banks in Singapore, members of the SGX-ST and merchant banks in Singapore. The Application List will open at 10.00 a.m. on 12 December 2001 and will remain open until 12.00 noon on the same day or for such further period or periods as we may, in consultation with the Manager, decide, subject to any limitations under all applicable laws. INDICATIVE TIMETABLE FOR LISTING In accordance with the SGX-ST's News Release of 28 May 1993 on the trading of initial public offering shares on a ``when issued'' basis, an indicative timetable is set out below for your reference:± Indicative Date/Time Event 12 December 2001, 12.00 noon Closing date and time for application 13 December 2001 Balloting of applications, if necessary (in the event of over-subscription for the Offer Shares) 14 December 2001, 9.00 a.m. Commence trading on a ``when issued'' basis 27 December 2001 Last day for trading on a ``when issued'' basis 28 December 2001, 9.00 a.m. Commence trading on a ``ready'' basis 3 January 2002 Settlement date for all trades done on a ``when issued'' basis and for all trades done on a ``ready'' basis on 28 December 2001 The above timetable is only indicative as it assumes that the closing of the Application List is 12 December 2001, the date of admission of our Company to the Of®cial List of the SGX-ST will be 14 December 2001, the SGX-ST's shareholding spread requirement will be complied with and the New Shares will be issued and fully paid-up prior to 14 December 2001. The actual date on which the Shares will commence trading on a ``when issued'' basis will be announced when it is con®rmed by the SGX-ST. In the event of any early or extended closure of the Application List or the shortening or extension of the time period during which the Invitation is open, we will publicly announce the same:± (i) through a MASNET announcement to be posted on the Internet at the SGX-ST website http://www.sgx.com; and (ii) in a major Singapore English newspaper such as The Straits Times or The Business Times. 15 DETAILS OF THE INVITATION The commencement of trading on a ``when issued'' basis will be entirely at the discretion of the SGX-ST. All persons trading in the Shares on a ``when issued'' basis do so at their own risk. In particular, persons trading in the Shares before their Securities Accounts with CDP are credited with the relevant number of Shares do so at the risk of selling Shares which neither they nor their nominees, as the case may be, have been allotted or are bene®cially entitled to.

Terms de®ned elsewhere in this Prospectus have the same meanings when used herein. Prospective investors should carefully consider the information presented in this Prospectus, particularly the matters set out under ``Risk Factors'', before buying our Shares. OVERVIEW OF OUR GROUP Our Company was incorporated in Bermuda on 13 June 2000 under the Bermuda Act as an exempted company with limited liability1 under the name of Tsit Wing International Holdings Limited. Our principal business activities are processing, wholesaling and distribution of food and beverage (``F&B'') products, mainly coffee and tea, in our primary markets of Hong Kong, PRC and Canada. We import, process and blend, and pack our coffee and tea products at our production facilities in Hong Kong and PRC. With our own processing plants and marketing efforts, we have built up an established market in the catering business, namely, the wholesaling and distribution of coffee and tea supplies to food establishments such as hotels, restaurants and fast food chains. Our customers include McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken (``KFC''), Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel & Towers and Ritz- Carlton Hotel. We currently supply to approximately 4,800 of the 5,928 food establishments in Hong Kong2 and 34 of the 81 hotels who are members of the Hong Kong Hotel Association3. Our market share of the catering business in Hong Kong therefore amounts to over 80%. In 1997, we ventured into the FMCG market and have since launched various instant and canned beverage products in both Hong Kong and PRC. Despite our short track record of approximately 4 years in the FMCG market, we have been ranked third in terms of sales value and sales volume of coffee mix (that is, 3-in-1 coffee mix) sold in the Hong Kong market based on market surveys conducted by ACNielsen, an international market research company4. In order to promote our products and our brand name, we have also established 3 cafeÂ s in Hong Kong. The cafeÂ located at Tsimshatsui is also a coffee specialty restaurant and the largest of our cafeÂ s. Our founder, Wong Keu, founded our Group in the early 1930s as a grocery shop. His son, Wong Sek Fook, joined the business in 1941. He retired as Chairman of our Group in 1999 but remains as an Adviser to our Board. Our Chairman and Managing Director, Wong Tat Tong, who is the grandson of Wong Keu, joined us in 1979 and has since been instrumental in steering our Group to extend our business network to other geographical regions beyond Hong Kong and diversifying our products and services to provide a fuller range of services to our customers. We pride ourselves in our ability to deliver quality products to our customers and strive to achieve consistency in taste and packaging to meet the requirements of each of our customers. We are also committed to provide prompt and reliable delivery to our customers and have undertaken to deliver our products to customers throughout Hong Kong within 24 hours. These competitive strengths have been built by our experienced and committed management team under the stewardship of Wong Tat Tong. He is supported by a team of 3 Executive Directors and 7 Executive Of®cers, of whom 9 have more than 15 years' experience each in their respective areas of expertise. With our established foothold in the Hong Kong and PRC markets, we believe that we are well- positioned to take advantage of any potential growth in the consumption of coffee and tea in Hong Kong and PRC as well as in the FMCG market. We plan to use HK$21.0 million (approximately S$5.0 million) out of the proceeds of the Invitation to expand our production facilities in Hong Kong and PRC. 1 ``Exempted company with limited liability'' refers to a company which is incorporated in Bermuda with limited liability and which is exempted from certain requirements imposed on local companies in Bermuda by the Bermuda Act.

Surveys are conducted by ACNielsen who furnishes reports on the results of the surveys to us on a bi-monthly basis. 17 PROSPECTUS SUMMARY THE INVITATION Size : 40,000,000 New Shares. The New Shares will, upon allotment and issue, rank pari passu in all respects with our existing issued Shares. Purpose of the Invitation : Our Directors consider that the listing of our Company and the quotation of our Shares on the SGX-ST will enhance the public image of our Group, and enable us to tap the capital markets for expansion of our operations. It will also provide members of the public, our employees and business associates an opportunity to participate in the equity of our Company. Use of Proceeds : The net proceeds from the issue of the New Shares of approximately S$9.0 million (after deducting the issue expenses of approximately S$2.6 million) will be used to ®nance our continued growth and development as follows:± (a) approximately S$5.0 million to acquire new machinery to improve our existing production facilities and for general business expansion; and (b) the balance of approximately S$4.0 million for general working capital. Details of (a) are set out under the heading ``Prospects, Business Strategies and Future Plans'' on pages 81 to 83 of this Prospectus. Pending the above speci®c deployment of the net proceeds, the funds may be added to our working capital, placed in ®xed deposits with banks or ®nancial institutions or invested in short- term money market or debt instruments, as our Directors may, in their absolute discretion, deem ®t. Issue Price : S$0.29 for each New Share. The Offer : The Offer comprises an offering of 2,000,000 Offer Shares to members of the public. The Placement : The Placement comprises an offering of 34,000,000 Placement Shares by way of placement and 4,000,000 Reserved Shares reserved for the employees and business associates of our Group. Of the 34,000,000 Placement Shares (other than the Reserved Shares), up to 7,500,000 Placement Shares (representing 4.7% of the enlarged issued share capital of the Company after the Invitation) will be offered at the Issue Price to Mitsui & Co (H.K.) Ltd (``Mitsui''), one of our major suppliers. We have had an established relationship with Mitsui for more than 12 years and Mitsui plays an important role in the sourcing of raw materials for our Group. Through Mitsui, we are assured of a steady supply of raw materials as well as quality and better cost control over our purchases. By offering Mitsui a strategic stake in our Company, we hope to further develop our relationship with Mitsui and to tap on the established international network of Mitsui. 18 PROSPECTUS SUMMARY Reserved Shares : Of the 38,000,000 Placement Shares, 4,000,000 Reserved Shares will be reserved for the employees and business associates of our Group. The Reserved Shares will be offered at the Issue Price. In the event that any of the Reserved Shares are not taken up, they will be made available to satisfy applications for Placement Shares by way of Application Forms or, in the event of an under- subscription for the Placement Shares, to satisfy applications made by members of the public for the Offer Shares. Listing Status : Our Shares will be quoted in S$ on the Main Board of the SGX-ST, subject to admission of our Company to the Of®cial List of the SGX-ST and permission for dealing in and for quotation of our Shares being granted by the SGX-ST. 19 PROSPECTUS SUMMARY Prospective investors should carefully consider and evaluate each of the following considerations and all of the other information set forth in this Prospectus before deciding to invest in our Shares. To the best of our Directors' knowledge and belief, all risk factors that are material to investors in making an informed judgment have been set out below. If any of the following considerations and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, ®nancial conditions, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such cases, the trading price of our Shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our Shares. Our business depends on the world-wide supply of coffee beans and tea leaves We utilise approximately 146 metric tonnes of coffee beans and 172 metric tonnes of tea leaves per month for our major products. Purchases of these tea and coffee raw materials accounted for 83% of our total raw material purchases, and tea and coffee raw materials constitute 87% of our total cost of production in FY2000. We source our supply of coffee beans mainly from coffee producing countries like Brazil, Colombia, Jamaica and Indonesia while our supply of tea leaves are sourced mainly from Sri Lanka. Shortages in the supply of coffee beans and tea leaves will increase the cost of our purchases and cause our profit margins to erode. The following factors may reduce the supply of coffee beans and tea leaves:± . unfavourable local and global weather conditions; . more stringent environmental and conservation regulations; . natural disasters; . labour strikes and other disturbances; and . disease or crop pests. In the past, we have not encountered any incidence of signi®cant shortages in our supply of coffee beans and tea leaves. The prices of our purchases are subject to ¯uctuations Our raw materials prices, in particular, coffee beans and tea leaves, are subject to price fluctuations of the underlying prices of coffee and tea commodities. Coffee and tea commodities' prices are subject to fluctuations in international commodity markets. Adverse upward movements in the prices of these commodities and consequential increase in our raw material prices will have a material adverse impact on the financial performance of our business. The monthly average commodity prices of coffee beans and tea leaves between May 1998 and April 2001 are as follows:± 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 May-98 Aug-98 Nov-98 Feb-99 May-99 Aug-99 Nov-99 Feb-00 May-00 Aug-00 Nov-00 Feb-01 Month US c en ts /p ou nd Coffee Tea Source : Bloomberg 20 RISK FACTORS To manage the potential impact of price ¯uctuations on our purchases of coffee beans and tea leaves, we maintain a 3 months' supply of physical stock of coffee beans and a 2 months' supply of physical stock of tea leaves at any one time. In addition, we enter into forward supply contracts for these raw materials for at least another 3 months. However, there is no assurance that the above efforts will successfully hedge against all price ¯uctuations. We rely on our major suppliers for our raw materials We rely on our major suppliers including Federacion Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia and Mitsui & Co (H.K.) Ltd for the supply of raw materials for our production. We also rely on Unilever Hong Kong Limited for the supply of Lipton Yellow Label tea in 10 lbs catering packs, of which we are the sole distributor in Hong Kong. These suppliers will order the raw materials such as coffee beans and tea leaves from the producers in countries like Brazil and Colombia for coffee beans and Sri Lanka for tea leaves. Besides supplying us with the physical stocks of raw material, our major suppliers also provide us with quality control checks on the raw materials that we import. In transacting through these suppliers, we are able to control the cost of our purchases better as our suppliers are international companies with established networks throughout the world. These networks allow them to source at competitive prices and provide us with better assurance of a steady supply of raw materials from the crop producers. While we may be able to purchase raw materials directly from the producers, the loss of our suppliers without suitable and timely replacement will lead to an increase in the cost of our purchases as we have to incur additional cost to impose quality control checks on our raw materials purchases. This will cause our pro®tability to decline. We rely on our trademarks which are essential to the development of our business We have in the past relied on numerous trademarks for the marketing and distribution of our products, some of which continue to be our present key trademarks for our products, in particular, trademarks like the ``Tsit Wing'' logo, ``General'', ``Admiral'', `` '', ``Our Pride'', `` '', ``Extra'', `` '', ``Ruby'', `` '' and `` ''. We have to date ®led trademark applications for the registration of certain of our marks, the details of which are set out under the heading ``Trademarks'' on pages 69 to 73 of this Prospectus. However, there is no assurance that all our ®led trademark registration applications as well as those that we intend to ®le will be approved by the relevant authorities. These trademark registration applications may be opposed by third parties and thus impede our ability to establish our brand names and corporate identity. We rely on the respective local trademark and trade security laws and con®dentiality procedures in the countries in which we operate to protect our trademark rights. There is no assurance that these means of protecting our trademarks will be effective or that our competitors will not adopt product names or marks similar to ours. The regulation of such unauthorised use is dif®cult and the law on trademarks and protection in some countries in which we operate may not be as developed as in other countries. There is also no assurance that our products do not and will not infringe other registered trademarks held by third parties. As such, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to such infringement. Any successful claim against us arising out of such proceedings could result in substantial monetary liability and will materially affect the continued sales of the affected products and our turnover and pro®tability. At present, we do not have any insurance to cover us against such liability. To date, we have not faced any such claims. 21 RISK FACTORS The FMCG industry is highly competitive and we have a relatively short track record in this segment The FMCG market is highly competitive as there are few barriers to entry and the industry has a number of well established companies with more recognisable and widely accepted brand names. The preferences of consumers are subject to rapid and unanticipated changes. As a result, we will face substantial competition from competitors who may have greater ®nancial and other resources to engage in widespread advertising and promotion campaigns for their products. We entered the FMCG market in PRC and Hong Kong only at the end of 1997 and in 1998 respectively and have been incurring losses during these initial years up until FY2000. As such, our FMCG business has a relatively short track record upon which you may evaluate us. We have, however, been ranked third in terms of sales value and sales volume of coffee mix (that is, 3-in-1 coffee mix) sold in the Hong Kong market based on market surveys between January 2001 and October 2001 conducted by ACNielsen, an international market research company1. Being a new entrant to this highly competitive market, we face numerous risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that we can successfully address all the risks faced by us in this environment. These risks include our ability to:± . earn sufficient revenue to cover our costs in the short run; . grow brand recognition over other established competitors; and . respond on time to developments and challenges in the FMCG market. Hence, there is no assurance that our products are and will continue to be readily accepted in the market. In the event that our products lose market acceptance, our turnover and pro®tability will be adversely affected. Our PRC operations have just achieved pro®tability in FY2000. There is no assurance that we can sustain pro®tability in our PRC operations in the future In PRC, we carry out our production operations in Zhuhai as well as engage in the catering and FMCG businesses. During our ®rst 6 years in PRC from 1994 to 1999, we had not been pro®table as we faced stiff competition from established competitors in PRC. In addition, we had to write off some bad debts as a result of the ®nancial dif®culties faced by some of our customers amidst the recession during 1997 and 1998, as well as the relatively less developed coffee consumption market in PRC. However, for FY2000 and the 6 months ended 30 June 2001, we managed to achieve pro®t before taxation of approximately HK$0.5 million and HK$0.1 million respectively from our operations in PRC. Further details on the ®nancial results of our PRC operations are set out in the section under the headings ``Selected Consolidated Financial Information'' on page 45 and ``Financial Review'' on pages 46 to 52 of this Prospectus. There is no assurance that we can sustain pro®tability in our PRC operations in the future. We are subject to the credit risk of our customers Our pro®tability is also dependent on the credit risk of our customers. From time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, certain customers may default on their payment to us. Although we review our credit exposure to our customers regularly, default risk may nevertheless arise from events or circumstances that are dif®cult to anticipate or detect. Economic and/or political pressures in a country in which we operate, including those arising from local market disruptions or currency crises, may adversely affect the ability of our customers located in that country to obtain foreign exchange or credit facilities to pay us. 1 Source: ACNielsen Retail Services (Coffee Mix) January ± October 2001. Surveys are conducted by ACNielsen who furnishes reports on the results of the surveys to us on a bi-monthly basis. 22 RISK FACTORS Such defaults in payments to us would adversely affect our profitability. Our provision for bad and doubtful debts from FY1998 to FY2000 and for the 6 months ended 30 June 2001 are as follows:± FY1998 FY1999 FY2000 6 months ended 30 June 2001 Provision for bad and doubtful debts (HK$'000) 1,884 1,886 2,056 510 Percentage of turnover (%) 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.4 Percentage of pro®t before taxation (%) 25.2 7.6 5.5 2.5 We rely on distributors to distribute our products in PRC and any disruption in their services could adversely affect our business We rely on a number of distributors to deliver our products to our customers in PRC. We consider coffee and tea to be perishable products and we rely on these distributors to deliver our products on a timely basis. We have no control over these distributors and services provided by them may be interrupted as a result of labour shortages, contract disputes and other factors. If we experience an interruption in their services, we may be unable to distribute our products in PRC in a timely manner. A delay in delivery could:± . have an adverse impact on the quality of our products and thus adversely affect our brand and reputation; and/or . require us to contract with alternative, and possibly more expensive, distributors. Any signi®cant increase in transportation cost could lower our pro®t margins or force us to raise prices. If we are unable to pass on the higher cost to our customers, our turnover and pro®tability could be adversely affected. Further details are set out in the section under the heading ``Business'' on pages 60 and 61 of this Prospectus. Our business depends on our ability to retain key personnel Our continued success is dependent to a large extent on our ability to retain the services of our key management and operational personnel. Also, in connection with our growth plans, we will need to recruit more experienced personnel. The loss of the services of certain existing key personnel without suitable and timely replacement or the inability to attract and retain quali®ed personnel will have an adverse impact on our operations and/or delay our expansion plans. In particular, the loss of the services of Wong Tat Tong, our Managing Director, will have an adverse impact on the turnover and pro®ts of our Group. We are dependent on the food manufacturing and other licences granted by the various government authorities Our plants in Hong Kong and Zhuhai, PRC require relevant licences from the respective government authorities in Hong Kong and PRC to carry on the business of food processing. The details of such licences are set out in the section under the heading ``Government Regulations'' on pages 75 and 76 of this Prospectus. These licences are generally valid for a year and renewable annually. The respective authorities will conduct random inspections on our premises to ensure that we are in compliance with the required regulations. In the event of a breach of any restriction or condition subject to which the licence was granted, the licence may be suspended or revoked. 23 RISK FACTORS The requirements set by the authorities are also subject to change and new requirements may be imposed from time to time. There is no assurance that the requirements set by the authorities will be met at all times. As such, should our licences be suspended or revoked, we will not be able to continue our production, which will result in a drop in production levels and prevent us from meeting the demand of our customers. This will have a material and adverse impact on our turnover and pro®tability. We are dependent on the general economies of Hong Kong and PRC We are principally engaged in the catering of coffee and tea to food establishments as well as the retail of FMCG products through supermarkets and convenience stores. We also operate 3 cafeÂ s in Hong Kong. As we are operating within the regions of Hong Kong and PRC, we are dependent on the economies of these regions. We recognise that any adverse changes in the economic conditions in these regions will affect consumers' spending patterns and therefore have a negative impact on the demand for our products or will result in a need for us to review our marketing strategies and our future expansion plans. This will have a material and adverse impact on our turnover and pro®tability. We may be subject to product liability claims We are engaged in the production of consumable food products, and we handle such food products in processed and unprocessed form. These food products are ultimately ingested by the end consumers. In the event that our food products contain defects as a result of negligence or omission or wilful action or sabotage, we may be subject to lawsuits and product liability claims for any accidental death, bodily injury or illness to any person or accidental damage to property. At present, we do not have any insurance to cover us against such liability. To date, we have not faced any such claims. We are subject to foreign exchange risk Our sales are denominated mainly in HKD and RMB (representing 89% and 10% of our total turnover for FY2000 respectively) as our primary markets are in Hong Kong and PRC. Our purchases are denominated mainly in HKD, USD and RMB (representing 68%, 23% and 5% of our total purchases in FY2000 respectively) re¯ecting the countries in which we locate our operations as well as the currency (mainly USD) of our major raw material purchases like coffee beans and tea leaves. To the extent that our sales and purchases are not matched in the same currency, we will be exposed to any adverse ¯uctuation of USD and RMB against HKD. As a result, our earnings may be materially and adversely affected. However, as the HKD is currently closely pegged to the USD at a rate of approximately US$1 to HK$7.8, our risk to foreign exchange ¯uctuations between USD and HKD is minimal. Similarly, the exchange rates between RMB and HKD have been relatively stable over the last 3 years and hence our exposure to foreign exchange ¯uctuations between RMB and HKD had been low. Our foreign exchange losses from FY1998 to FY2000 and for the 6 months ended 30 June 2001 are disclosed in the section under the heading ``Foreign Exchange Exposure'' on page 55 of this Prospectus. However, there is no assurance that the HKD will remain closely pegged to the USD in the future or that the RMB/HKD exchange rates will remain stable in the future. Hence, should there be any signi®cant adverse ¯uctuations in the exchange rates of USD and/or RMB against HKD, our ®nancial performance will be adversely affected. At present, we do not have any formal policy to hedge against our foreign currency exposure. We may, when necessary, enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against exposure from foreign currency ¯uctuations. However, there is no assurance that our efforts will successfully hedge against all foreign currency ¯uctuations. In line with the country of incorporation, the accounts of our major overseas subsidiaries in PRC and Canada are prepared in their respective currencies, namely, RMB and C$. This represents a translation risk in that any material ¯uctuation in the relevant currencies against HKD will have an effect on our consolidated ®nancial statements which are presented in HKD. 24 RISK FACTORS Our operations could be adversely affected by changes in the political and economic conditions in PRC Besides Hong Kong, we also have production facilities in Zhuhai, PRC. Changes in the social, economic and political conditions of PRC may adversely affect our business. Unfavourable changes in government policies, political unrest and economic developments may also have a negative impact on our operations. Since the adoption of the ``open door policy'' in 1978 and the ``socialist market economy'' in 1993, the PRC government has been reforming its economic and political systems. Any change in the political and economic policy of the PRC government may lead to a change in the laws and regulations or the interpretation of the same, as well as changes in the foreign exchange regulations, taxation and import and export restrictions, which may in turn adversely affect our ®nancial performance. While the current policy of the PRC government appears to be one of pursuing economic reform policies to encourage foreign investments and greater economic decentralisation, there is no assurance that such a policy will continue to prevail in the future. Our operations in PRC are subject to the laws and regulations promulgated by the PRC government. The PRC legal system is a codi®ed legal system made up of written laws, regulations, circulars, administrative directives and internal guidelines. Unlike common law jurisdictions like the United Kingdom and Singapore, decided cases do not form part of the legal structure of PRC and thus have no binding effect. As such, the administration of PRC laws and regulations may be subject to a certain degree of discretion by the authorities. This has resulted in the outcome of dispute resolutions not having the level of consistency or predictability as in other countries with more developed legal systems. Furthermore, in line with its transformation from a centrally planned economy to a more free market oriented economy and with the recent entry of PRC into the World Trade Organisation (``WTO''), the PRC government is in the process of developing a comprehensive set of laws and regulations. As the legal system in PRC is still evolving, laws and regulations or the interpretation of the same may be subject to change. A takeover offer for your Shares may not be made in accordance with the Singapore Takeover and Merger Laws and Regulations There are presently no requirements under any Bermuda laws or regulations on takeover offers for our Shares which would be applicable to us. In addition, the Singapore Takeover and Merger Laws and Regulations apply only to takeover offers for public companies incorporated in Singapore and not to companies incorporated outside Singapore. As we are a company incorporated in Bermuda, the Singapore Takeover and Merger Laws and Regulations do not apply to acquisitions of our Shares. Although Bye-Law 193 of our Bye-Laws incorporate the Singapore Takeover and Merger Laws and Regulations by reference and will, due to its binding effect on our Members, require any of our Members who make takeover offers for our Shares to comply with the Singapore Takeover and Merger Laws and Regulations, it is uncertain whether this can be enforced in respect of persons who are not our Members. This is because Bye-Law 193 only binds our Members and a person (including a corporation) who is not our Member will not be bound to comply with the Singapore Takeover and Merger Laws and Regulations. This may affect you because based on existing rules and regulations, in the event that a person (not being one of our Members), whether alone or together with parties acting in concert with him, acquires or gains control of 25% or more of our Shares, or, in the event that he already owns or controls 25% or more and not more than 50% of our Shares and acquires an additional 3% of our Shares within any 12-month period, you may not be offered an opportunity to sell your Shares to such an acquiror at the price he had paid for those Shares. In addition, even if a takeover offer is made for our Shares, such a takeover may not be made in accordance with the procedure stipulated in the Singapore Takeover and Merger Laws and Regulations. 25 RISK FACTORS Future sale of Shares could adversely affect our Share price Any future sale of Shares can have a downward pressure on our Share price. The sale of a signi®cant number of Shares in the public market after the Invitation, or the perception that such sales may occur, could materially adversely affect the market price of our Shares. These factors also affect our ability to issue additional equity securities. Except as otherwise described under the heading ``Moratorium'' on page 37 of this Prospectus, there will be no restriction on the ability of the substantial Shareholders to sell their Shares either on the SGX-ST or otherwise. New investors of our Shares pursuant to the Invitation will face immediate and substantial dilution in the book value per Share and may experience future dilution The Issue Price of our Shares is substantially higher than the book value (or NTA) per Share based on the post-Invitation share capital. Thus, new investors to the Invitation will suffer an immediate and substantial dilution in the book value per Share attributable to them. Details of the immediate dilution of our Shares faced by our new investors are described in the section under the heading ``Dilution'' on page 39 of this Prospectus. In addition, we intend to grant our Directors and employees share options to acquire our Shares under the Tsit Wing Employees' Share Option Scheme 2001. To the extent such outstanding options are ultimately exercised at an exercise price which is below the Issue Price, there will be further dilution to investors participating in the Invitation. Details of the Tsit Wing Employees' Share Option Scheme 2001 are set out in the section of the same title on pages 92 to 96 and Annex C of this Prospectus. There has been no prior market for our Shares and the initial public offering may not result in an active or liquid market for our Shares Prior to the Invitation, there has been no public market for our Shares. Therefore, we cannot assure investors that an active public market will develop or be sustained after the Invitation. The Issue Price was determined by negotiations between the Manager and ourselves and may not be indicative of prices that may prevail in the trading market after the completion of the Invitation. Investors may not be able to sell their Shares at or above the Issue Price. The volatility in the trading price of our Shares may be caused by factors outside our control and may be unrelated or disproportionate to our ®nancial results. Our Directors and substantial Shareholders may have a signi®cant deemed interest in our Shares, which may allow them to in¯uence the outcome of matters submitted to Shareholders for approval Upon completion of the Invitation, our present Executive Directors, namely, Wong Tat Tong and Wong Tat Pui, may have an aggregate deemed interest in 71.4% of our post-Invitation issued share capital. As a result, these persons, if they act together, may be able to exercise signi®cant in¯uence over all matters requiring Shareholders' approval, including the election and removal of Directors and the approval of any business transactions, and may have veto power with respect to any Shareholders' action or approval requiring a majority vote. Such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control that may bene®t Shareholders.

Since 30 June 2001 to the date of this Prospectus, there were no material changes in our total capitalisation and indebtedness, save for the changes in retained earnings arising from the day-to-day operations in the ordinary course of business. 38 CAPITALISATION AND INDEBTEDNESS The audited NTA of our Group as at 30 June 2001 was HK$78.6 million (approximately S$18.4 million) or S$0.15 per Share. NTA per Share is determined by dividing our NTA (total tangible assets less total liabilities and minority interest) as at 30 June 2001, by the number of outstanding Shares as at that date. Based on the issue of 40,000,000 New Shares at an Issue Price of S$0.29 per Share pursuant to the Invitation and after deducting estimated issue expenses, the adjusted NTA of our Group as at 30 June 2001 would have been S$0.17 per Share. This represents an immediate increase in NTA of S$0.02 per Share to our Shareholders and an immediate dilution in NTA of S$0.12 per Share to new investors. The following table illustrates this per Share dilution:± Per Share S$ Per Share S$ Issue Price per Share 0.29 Adjusted NTA per Share as at 30 June 2001 0.15 Increase in NTA per Share contributed by new investors 0.02 Adjusted NTA per Share after the Invitation 0.17 Dilution in NTA per Share to new investors 0.12 The following table summarises the total number of Shares issued by us, the total consideration paid to us and the average price paid per Share by our existing Shareholders and by our new investors pursuant to the Invitation:± Shares Issued Total Consideration Average Price per Share Number ('000) % S$'000 % S$ Existing Shareholders 120,000 75.0 18,368 61.3 0.15 New investors 40,000 25.0 11,600 38.7 0.29 Total 160,000 100.0 29,968 100.0 0.19 39 DILUTION We began our restructuring exercise on 30 December 1999, eventually resulting in our Company becoming the investment holding company of our Group (the ``Restructuring Exercise''). The Restructuring Exercise was also undertaken to streamline and rationalise our Group structure and business activities for the purpose of listing our Shares on the SGX-ST. On 29 November 2001, we entered into an agreement for the acquisition of all the issued ordinary shares in the capital of TW International together with all the rights and advantages attaching thereto with effect from 1 July 2001 (save for the dividend declared in respect of FY2000). Our Group structures prior to the Restructuring Exercise and following the Restructuring Exercise are set out on pages 42 and 43 respectively of this Prospectus. On 13 June 2000, our Company was incorporated under the laws of Bermuda with an authorised share capital of HK$100,000 comprising 1,000,000 ordinary shares of HK$0.10 each and an issued share capital comprising 1,000,000 nil-paid shares of HK$0.10 each. On 29 November 2001, we consolidated every 5 ordinary shares of HK$0.10 each in the authorised and issued share capital of our Company into 2 ordinary shares of HK$0.25 each. We also increased our authorised share capital to HK$100,000,000 comprising 400,000,000 ordinary shares of HK$0.25 each. The Share Consolidation is further described in the section under the heading ``Share Capital'' on page 34 of this Prospectus. As a result, the 1,000,000 ordinary nil-paid shares of HK$0.10 each were consolidated into 400,000 Shares. The Restructuring Exercise involved the following:± (a) Voluntary liquidation of Tsit Wing (China) Investment Limited and Beijing Tsit Wing CafeÂ Shop Co., Ltd On 24 May 2000 and 4 October 2000, we executed and completed the voluntary liquidation of Beijing Tsit Wing CafeÂ Shop Co., Ltd and Tsit Wing (China) Investment Limited1 (``Tsit Wing China (BVI)'') respectively. Tsit Wing China (BVI) was set up to operate a coffee and tea processing company, TW Zhuhai, and a cafeÂ -operating company, Beijing Tsit Wing CafeÂ Shop Co., Ltd. As a result of a change in joint venture partners, TW Investment was set up and shares of TW Zhuhai previously held by Tsit Wing China (BVI) were transferred to TW Investment. Further details of this are set out in the section under the heading ``History'' on page 57 of this Prospectus. Following the transfer, a decision was also reached to liquidate Beijing Tsit Wing CafeÂ Shop Co., Ltd. This was because the cafeÂ was located at a railway station whose operational start date has been delayed inde®nitely and as a result made it no longer viable to operate the cafeÂ . As both companies became dormant following the events mentioned, we decided to liquidate both companies. (b) Transfer of shares of TW Australia held by TW Malaysia to TW International On 5 June 2000, TW Malaysia, our wholly-owned subsidiary, transferred its entire 80% equity interest of 800 ordinary shares of A$1.00 each in TW Australia to TW International for a consideration of A$800. This was undertaken to streamline our Group structure such that TW Australia is directly held by TW International. Following the transfer, TW Malaysia became dormant. Subsequently on 22 November 2000, Wong Tat Pui and Tsim Man Lam transferred their aggregate 20% equity interest of 200 ordinary shares of A$1.00 each in TW Australia to TW International for a consideration of A$200. Following this, TW Australia became a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Group. 1 Tsit Wing China (BVI) was incorporated in BVI and is distinct from TW Investment, our 53%-owned subsidiary which was incorporated in Hong Kong, although both companies bear the same name. 40 RESTRUCTURING EXERCISE (c) Redemption of all the issued redeemable preference shares in the capital TW International On 30 December 1999, the directors of TW International passed a resolution to redeem the 10,000 preference shares of US$0.01 each held by Snappy Performance Ltd for US$100. The redemption was completed in June 2000. The preference shares were deemed to be cancelled after the redemption. (d) Acquisition by our Company of the entire issued share capital of TW International Prior to 29 November 2001, TW International was the holding company of all the subsidiaries of our Group. On 29 November 2001, we acquired all the issued ordinary shares in the capital of TW International, comprising 1,027,600 ordinary shares of US$0.01 each for a consideration of HK$78,563,000 which is based on the consolidated NTA of TW International and its subsidiaries as at 30 June 2001. The purchase consideration was satis®ed by (i) the issue and allotment of 119,600,000 new Shares and (ii) the crediting as fully paid of the 400,000 Shares issued nil-paid upon incorporation of our Company. The difference between the excess value of the shares of TW International acquired by our Company and the nominal value of the Shares issued by our Company arising from the aforementioned transaction amounting to HK$48,563,000 was credited to the contributed surplus account of our Company. Following the sale of shares of TW International, Prosperous Town, Global King, Swift Mind, Au Ping Fui, Cheung On and Wong Kam Wing, being the vendors (``Vendors'') of TW International, entered into an agreement to transfer their Shares to Wong's Brothers Consortium in consideration of which Wong's Brothers Consortium agreed to allot and issue to the Vendors new ordinary shares in the capital of Wong's Brothers Consortium. In a further agreement, Au Ping Fui, Cheung On and Wong Kam Wing agreed to sell their shares in Wong's Brothers Consortium for cash to Prosperous Town and Global King. Wong Kam Wing is one of our Executive Of®cers. Au Ping Fui and Cheung On are not related to our Directors or our substantial Shareholders. Further details of our shareholding structure are set out in the section under the heading ``Shareholders'' on page 36 of this Prospectus. 41 RESTRUCTURING EXERCISE Our Group structure prior to the Restructuring Exercise as described on pages 40 and 41 of this Prospectus is as follows:± TW Coffee (Hong Kong) TW Hong Kong (Hong Kong) TW Enterprises (Canada) TW Trading (BVI) TW International (BVI) TW Investment (Hong Kong)(2) Tsit Wing (China) Investment Limited(1) (BVI) TW Malaysia (Malaysia) TW Zhuhai(3) (PRC) Beijing Tsit Wing Cafe Shop Co., Ltd (PRC) TW Australia (Australia) 100%55%53% 80%89%90% 100%100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% Cadiz (Hong Kong) TW Café (Hong Kong) TW China (Hong Kong) TW Canada (Canada) The country of incorporation of our subsidiaries are shown in parentheses.

The distribution of coffee and tea accounted for approximately 32% and 51% respectively of our catering sales for FY2000. The remaining 17% of our catering sales was attributable to the distribution of grocery items such as butter, creamer and evaporated milk, and the distribution of coffee machines. Our sales from the FMCG business are relatively low as we only entered the market in PRC at the end of 1997 and in Hong Kong in 1998. Sales from our cafeÂ business are also low as we currently only have 3 cafeÂ s in operation since we ®rst started in 1994. These 3 cafeÂ s are located in Hong Kong, the latest of which was opened in June 2000. Our retail business was carried out to promote our coffee and tea beverages and to build brand awareness of our products. We believe that such publicity in the retail sector will facilitate our market penetration in the FMCG business as well as the catering business. The Hong Kong market currently contributes close to 90% of our total turnover. In Hong Kong, we operate in all of our business segments, namely, catering, FMCG and cafeÂ retail businesses while we undertake only catering and FMCG businesses in PRC. Our sales in Canada, which comprise only catering business, are relatively insigni®cant and account for only about 1% of our turnover. Normally, our new cafeÂ s are not pro®table during the initial running-in period due to the level of ®xed operating expenses when sales have yet to be established. New cafeÂ s may also experience overruns in material and ingredient consumption during this period due to initial uncertainties such as customer traf®c and demand. Under our current operating conditions, our new cafeÂ s take approximately 12 to 18 months to become pro®table. Similarly, new FMCG products launched take a period of approximately 36 to 60 months to become pro®table. This is because of the need to incur advertising and promotion expenses to promote and market the new products. We also need to pay listing fees to supermarkets and convenience stores on a per outlet basis to place our new products on the shelves of these outlets. Our sales are dependent mainly on the general economies of Hong Kong and PRC. Our sales during the Lunar New Year season are traditionally lower as beverage consumption tend to shift towards the consumption of alcoholic beverages and soft drinks instead of coffee, tea and other hot beverages. The reverse trend is observed during the winter months from November to January when we see an increase in the consumption of coffee and tea. Our cost of production comprises approximately 93% in raw materials, 3% in labour and 4% in overheads. Green coffee beans account for approximately 84% of the raw material costs for coffee production and tea leaves account for approximately 93% of the raw material costs for tea production. The prices of these raw materials are subject to price ¯uctuations depending on international commodity markets. We are hence subject to the ¯uctuations of coffee and tea commodity prices. Further details on the volatility of prices of our purchases are set out in the section under the heading ``Risk Factors'' on pages 20 and 21 of this Prospectus. However, we minimise our exposure in this respect by keeping a minimum of 3 months' inventory supply of physical stocks and entering into forward supply contracts for at least another 3 months with our coffee suppliers. This gives us the assurance of prices and supply of raw materials for a minimum of 6 months. Similarly, we minimise our exposure to tea price ¯uctuations by keeping a minimum of 2 months' inventory and entering into forward supply contracts of another 4 months, to give us an assured price and supply of tea leaves for a minimum of 6 months. In addition, we monitor the coffee and tea commodity prices and our purchases on a monthly rolling basis. 46 FINANCIAL REVIEW Our gross pro®t margin for our FMCG business is generally lower than that of our catering market as we have to maintain competitive prices in view of intense competition in this business. We also incur higher advertising and promotion expenses to promote our products in the FMCG market as we are a relatively new player. At present, sales contribution from the FMCG business is relatively insigni®cant. However, if sales contribution from the FMCG business increases more than our catering business, we would expect our overall gross pro®t margin to decrease since gross pro®t margin from our FMCG business is lower than our catering business, although absolute gross pro®t would increase due to higher sales. In addition, our cafeÂ business generally yields gross pro®t margins that are relatively higher than that of our catering business but net pro®t margins from our cafeÂ business tends to be low because of higher operating costs. Our operating expenses comprise mainly salaries which account for approximately 50% of total operating expenses. Other major operating expenses include advertising and promotion expenses which account for 9% of total operating expenses, and rent and utilities which in aggregate account for approximately 8% of total operating expenses. Our operations in Hong Kong, PRC and Canada are taxed in accordance with the prevailing tax regulations in the respective countries. The statutory tax rates are 16%, 33%1 and 43.95% in Hong Kong, PRC and Canada respectively. As TW Zhuhai is a sino-foreign investment enterprise established in PRC and is located within a special economic zone, it is subject to the tax rate of 15% (50% of the statutory state income tax rate of 30%) on the assessable pro®ts for each calender year. In addition, according to existing tax regulations, TW Zhuhai is exempted from tax for the ®rst 2 years of pro®table operations and will enjoy a tax reduction of 50% for the following 3 years of operations. No provision for income tax charges has been made by TW Zhuhai due to the tax exemption entitlement. However, the PRC tax authority is revisiting the tax position of TW Zhuhai and is of the opinion that certain expenses of TW Zhuhai are not tax deductible. No assessment has been issued by the PRC tax authority to date. The Directors estimate that the aggregate sum of income tax payable for the period of its date of establishment to 31 December 2000 would be insigni®cant. However, the tax exemption as described above could be deemed as having commenced and the income for the ®nancial periods after 31 December 2000 will be subject to state income tax rate of either 7.5% or 15% depending on the ®nal agreement with the tax authority. REVIEW OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FY1998 vs FY1999 Turnover. Turnover increased by 5% or HK$10.6 million from HK$207.6 million in FY1998 to HK$218.2 million in FY1999, with our catering business contributing 64% of the increase and our FMCG and cafeÂ businesses contributing 22% and 14% of the increase respectively. The increase in our catering business was due mainly to the increase in both coffee and tea catering in Hong Kong, the former due to higher average selling price and the latter due to higher sales volume. The increase in turnover was in line with the recovery of the Hong Kong and PRC economies which saw our existing customers expanding their number of outlets. Overall, our FMCG business increased by 40% or HK$2.4 million from HK$5.9 million in FY1998 to HK$8.3 million in FY1999 as we gained greater market penetration with our existing products and the introduction of our 2 new products during the year. During the ®rst half of FY1999, our sales were affected as we terminated the services of the distributor in Hong Kong due to poor performance of the distributor and undertook the distribution function ourselves through our sales and marketing team. This resulted in us having to re-list our products and undertake additional promotional efforts in promoting our products in supermarkets. As a result, we only managed to regain market acceptance in the second half of FY1999. 1 Comprising state income tax rate of 30.0% and local income tax rate of 3.0%. 47 FINANCIAL REVIEW Turnover from the cafeÂ business increased by 24% or HK$1.4 million from HK$5.9 million in FY1998 to HK$7.3 million in FY1999 due mainly to the full year's contribution from our new cafeÂ which opened in the second half of FY1998 and the contribution from another new cafeÂ which opened in January 1999. These 2 cafeÂ s in Hong Kong were subsequently closed in December 1999. This was because customer traf®c in the area which one of our cafeÂ s operated in was too sparse while the landlord of the other cafeÂ ceased operations. Geographically, approximately 81% of the increase in turnover was derived from Hong Kong while the increase in turnover from PRC was relatively modest as our sales were dampened by the stringent credit control measures we adopted with a view to minimising our exposure to bad and doubtful debts. Gross pro®t. Gross pro®t for FY1999 increased by 22% or HK$17.3 million from HK$77.7 million in FY1998 to HK$95.0 million in FY1999. This was due mainly to the catering and FMCG businesses in Hong Kong, which accounted for 95% of the increase. Our overall gross pro®t margin increased from 37% in FY1998 to 44% in FY1999 due mainly to decreases in the cost of green coffee beans and tea leaves by approximately 20% and 9% respectively. Our gross pro®t from our PRC operations, however, registered a slight decrease as we reduced our prices to remain competitive amidst the stiff competition and ®nancial dif®culties still faced by some of our PRC customers during the initial period of recovery after the economic slowdown. General and administration (``G&A''). G&A expenses accounted for 48% of total operating expenses in FY1999. G&A expenses consist of mainly staff salaries, rent and utilities. Our G&A expenses increased by HK$1.5 million in line with the increase in turnover. This was due mainly to an increase in salaries of HK$1.0 million due to annual salary increments and increase in head count, and an increase in exchange loss of HK$0.7 million from HK$0.2 million in FY1998 to HK$0.9 million in FY1999 due to settlement of trade debts by PRC customers when the RMB weakened against the HKD. These increases were partially offset by cost savings of HK$0.3 million from spare parts consumed for the maintenance of coffee machines as there were less calls for repairs from customers during the year. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of mainly salaries, commissions as well as other related costs of sales personnel, advertising and promotion expenses. Advertising and promotion expenses were incurred mainly for new product launches to create market awareness of the Tsit Wing brand and promotion of our cafeÂ s. Sales and marketing expenses increased by 1% or HK$0.4 million due mainly to additional costs incurred in relation to our new cafeÂ . These costs included the salaries of additional staff recruited for the new cafeÂ and renovation expenses incurred for the cafeÂ . Operating pro®t. Our operating pro®t increased signi®cantly by 153% or HK$15.5 million from HK$10.1 million in FY1998 to HK$25.6 million due mainly to the increase in our gross pro®t which improved on the back of lower raw material cost. At the same time, we managed to control the level of our operating expenses as a percentage of sales with better cost control measures such as assigning additional functions to existing staff so as to reduce the need to recruit new staff as well as implementing inventory control measures to reduce stock holding costs. Interest expense. Interest expense consists of mainly trust receipt interest and interest paid to suppliers who provide interest bearing credit terms of up to 90 days. Interest expense decreased by HK$1.5 million to HK$1.3 million as our joint venture in PRC could independently provide their own funding and no longer required the ®nancial support from our Group and the minority shareholders. The improved cash position from our operations also enabled us to reduce our existing borrowings from HK$21.6 million in FY1998 to HK$2.1 million in FY1999. Other income. Other income which comprises gain on disposal of ®xed assets, interest earned from time deposits and other deposits placed with banks. Other income increased by HK$0.3 million from HK$0.2 million in FY1998 to HK$0.5 million in FY1999. This was due mainly to additional time deposits of approximately HK$6.0 million placed with banks and ®nancial institutions during the year. 48 FINANCIAL REVIEW Pro®t before taxation. Pro®t before taxation increased signi®cantly by 231% from HK$7.5 million to HK$24.7 million contributed mainly by our catering business which increased by HK$18.2 million but this was partially offset by a loss of HK$1.7 million incurred by our cafeÂ due to ®xed assets written off as a result of early termination of tenancy agreements. Our overall PBT margin increased by 7.7 percentage points from 3.6% in FY1998 to 11.3% in FY1999. This was due mainly to an improvement in PBT margins from our catering business by 8.8 percentage points which was attributable to higher margins in our catering business as a result of decreasing cost of raw materials and increased turnover as a result of increasing our market share in Hong Kong. Our pro®tability in Hong Kong improved from HK$11.3 million in FY1998 to HK$25.4 million in FY1999 due mainly to the increase in turnover derived from Hong Kong as well as an improvement in PBT margin achieved in Hong Kong. Our loss in PRC decreased partially due to higher sales achieved during the year. We also exercised stringent credit controls to minimise our exposure to bad debts. While we made a one-time write-off of coffee machines in FY1998 due to the cessation of business of some of our PRC customers, this was not repeated in FY1999. Our operations in Canada remained modest during the year and we did not record any signi®cant growth in pro®tability during the year. FY1999 vs FY2000 Turnover. Turnover increased by 7% or HK$15.7 million from HK$218.2 million in FY1999 to HK$233.9 million in FY2000. Although our catering and FMCG businesses continued to record annual increments of 6% and 43% respectively, the turnover of our cafeÂ shops dropped by 10% or HK$0.8 million. The reduction in retail sales was due to the closure of 2 cafeÂ shops in December 1999 despite the contribution of 6 months' turnover of HK$3.9 million by our new cafeÂ restaurant which opened in June 2000 in Hong Kong. Following the progressive recovery of the Asian economy, our sales in Hong Kong and PRC each attained a satisfactory growth of 7% whilst our sales in Canada also improved by 11%. The growth in the Hong Kong market was mainly derived from our sales to the catering segment, which contributed 85% of the total increase and in line with the improved purchasing power of the general public and the higher beverage consumption in the outlets of our customers. In terms of products, coffee sales increased by 1% while tea recorded total sales of HK$106.5 million representing an increase of 12% as compared with last year and accounting for the highest contribution to our turnover growth in Hong Kong. This increase in sales of tea was a result of a 10% increase in sales volume coupled with a 2% increase in selling price of our tea products. Our development in the FMCG market in Hong Kong was also encouraging. With the introduction of new products and further expansion of the distribution network by listing our products for sales in more supermarkets and convenient stores, our total FMCG sales in Hong Kong moved upwards by HK$2.9 million equivalent to an annual increase of 106%. The growth in our PRC sales was due mainly to the recovery of beverage consumption in the catering segment. Our sales to the catering and FMCG market in PRC increased by 5% and 12% respectively, and the sales of tea products increased by 40% as a result of the growth of our PRC market share with the opening of more Hong Kong style tea bistros in major China cities, especially in the Guangdong province. The growth in our share of the FMCG market was a result of increased promotion efforts undertaken by our distributors in PRC. Our development in Canada grew steadily with our major sales focused on the catering segment to the Chinese community. Gross pro®t. Gross pro®t for FY2000 increased by 14% or HK$13.6 million from HK$95.0 million in FY1999 to HK$108.6 million in FY2000. This was attributable to the increases in turnover and gross pro®t margins. Our overall pro®t margin improved by 2 percentage points over FY1999 because the cost of green coffee beans and tea leaves continued to decrease in FY2000 since the second half of FY1999 after a sharp rise in FY1998. The improvement in the gross margin of tea was also due to an average increase of approximately 2% in the selling price of our tea products with effect from the middle of the year. The price increase was a business move following the announcement in the ®rst half of FY2000 by Unilever Hong Kong Limited (``Unilever'') to increase the selling price of Yellow Label tea, of which Unilever is the international distributor and we are the sole distributor in Hong 49 FINANCIAL REVIEW Kong. While the gross margins of FMCG products are comparatively lower than the margins earned from sales in the catering segment, the overall FMCG margin in FY2000 also improved by 3 percentage points as a result of lower cost of raw materials and lower unit cost due to an increase in sales volume. G&A. G&A expenses were contained at similar levels as FY1999 with a slight increase of approximately HK$12,000 which represented an increase of less than 0.1%. During the year, our exchange loss, legal expenses and telecommunication charges decreased by HK$0.9 million, HK$0.3 million and HK$0.1 million respectively. We reduced our exchange loss because of favourable ¯uctuations in RMB against HKD. Also, while we wrote off ®xed assets of HK$1.7 million in FY1999 due to the closure of 2 cafeÂ s, this was a one-time write-off which was not repeated in FY2000. These decreases in G&A expenses were, however, negated by an increase in salaries of HK$2.9 million due mainly to salary increments of our staff and executive directors as well as an increase in the provision of year-end bonus in view of the increase in pro®tability in FY2000 and an increase in provision for doubtful trade receivables in line with the increase in sales. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased by 6.5% or HK$2.4 million over the past year. Although the closure of 2 cafeÂ shops in FY1999 gave rise to cost savings of HK$1.8 million for the ®rst half of FY2000, the opening of a new restaurant in June 2000 narrowed down the cost savings to HK$1.6 million for the year. Advertising and promotion expenses of HK$2.5 million were spent to secure a successful launch of our new product, TW Canned Coffee. Advertising and promotion activities undertaken for the launch of TW Canned Coffee included television advertising and special promotions with free sample giveaways at supermarkets in Hong Kong. Provision for commission and year-end bonus for sales staff was increased by HK$0.8 million in relation to the higher sales volume. Storage and delivery expenses were HK$0.6 million higher than FY1999 to cope with the higher sales volume and inventory handling. Operating pro®t. Our operating pro®t increased by 44% or HK$11.2 million from HK$25.6 million in FY1999 to HK$36.8 million in FY2000 due mainly to the overall increase in turnover and signi®cant improvement of our cafeÂ business as well as our PRC operations. Our cafeÂ business recorded a pro®t of HK$0.4 million due to the closure of 2 non-pro®t generating cafeÂ s in FY1999. Our PRC operations also successfully turned from an operating loss of HK$0.9 million in FY1999 to a operating pro®t of HK$0.6 million in FY2000 due mainly to an increase in turnover. Interest expense. Interest expense decreased by 36% or HK$0.5 million due to our continued strong cash position, which enabled us to minimise our borrowings from our bankers as well as the reliance of ®nancial support from major suppliers. Other income. The increase of HK$0.7 million in other income was due to an increase in interest income because time deposits of an average balance of approximately HK$18.0 million were placed with banks during FY2000 while we only placed time deposits of approximately HK$6.0 million with banks during FY1999. Pro®t before taxation. Pro®t before taxation increased by 50% or HK$12.3 million from HK$24.7 million in FY1999 to HK$37.1 million in FY2000. This was in line with the increase in sales and gross margins while we managed to contain increases in operating expenses. We were successful in turning all our 3 major markets, namely Hong Kong, PRC and Canada into pro®t generating markets. Although our pro®t contribution still substantially relied on the sales to the catering segment, our FMCG sales and cafeÂ business showed signi®cant improvement as a result of better brand awareness, expansion of distribution outlets and increased product variety. 50 FINANCIAL REVIEW 6 months ended 30 June 2000 vs 6 months ended 30 June 2001 Turnover. Turnover for the ®rst half of FY2001 was HK$122.5 million, representing an increase of 5% or HK$6.2 million compared to the 6 months ended 30 June 2000. This increase was due mainly to the continuous improvement of our FMCG sales in Hong Kong and PRC and the additional income generated by our cafeÂ which opened in June 2000 in Hong Kong. Our catering business remained fairly stable for the 6 month-period ended 30 June 2001 over the corresponding period in FY2000. Our FMCG turnover recorded a growth rate of 169% or HK$2.8 million in Hong Kong and an increase of 29% or HK$0.8 million in PRC, accounting for a total increase of 83% or HK$3.6 million. The introduction of another ready-to-drink product, TW canned milk tea, in March 2001 contributed sales of HK$0.6 million or 17% of the total increase. Other major contributors to our sales were the successful listing of our products for sale in more supermarkets and retail outlets, the promotional activities carried out to stimulate impulse purchases by consumers and the increase in market acceptance of our products after our three and a half years' participation in this highly competitive market. These factors led to the increase in sales of our 3-in-1 product series by approximately HK$2.1 million which represents a 45% increase in the ®rst half of FY2001 over the corresponding period in FY2000. Other products which experienced similar increase in sales include our bottled soluble coffee and canned coffee which each achieved increases of HK$0.9 million. Turnover from our cafeÂ business surged by 207% or HK$3.0 million for the 6 months ended 30 June 2001 as compared with the corresponding period in FY2000. This is because we had 3 cafeÂ s operating this year while only 2 cafeÂ s were in service at the beginning of FY2000. Our third cafeÂ opened in late June 2000. Our total sales in PRC increased approximately by 10% or HK$1.1 million from HK$10.8 million to HK$11.9 million. Other than the FMCG growth in PRC of 29%, our sales to the catering segment also attained an increase of 2.8%, attributable mainly to the higher sales of tea products to the Hong Kong style tea bistros mushrooming in the Guangdong province and the supply of instant beverage products to more domestic airlines. Continuing with the upward trend of FY2000, our Canadian operation achieved a double-digit growth rate of 14% for the 6 months ended 30 June 2001. Despite the continuous expansion of our sales in PRC and Canada, our Hong Kong market experienced a decrease of 1% or HK$0.9 million in its sales to the catering segment, causing the overall catering sales to decline by HK$0.5 million. This decrease in Hong Kong catering sales was due mainly to decreases in coffee and tea sales. However, these decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of other grocery items in our catering business. Sales of our core products, coffee and tea, declined in the ®rst 6 months of FY2001 as compared with the corresponding period in FY2000 because in FY2000 we saw an increase in customers' demand for these products as a result of anticipated increases in prices. As such, when prices stabilised in FY2001, sales of our core products returned to levels prior to exceptional sales levels experienced in the ®rst half of FY2000. Gross pro®t. Gross pro®t for the 6 months ended 30 June 2001 increased by 13% or HK$6.9 million as compared with the corresponding period in FY2000 due mainly to the increase in turnover and gross pro®t margin. Our overall pro®t margin improved by 3 percentage points. This was achieved partially through the higher selling prices for our tea products effected from the second half of FY2000 while the cost of tea leaves had remained stable throughout the ®rst 6 months of FY2001. In addition, the cost of coffee beans decreased while average selling price of coffee remained. Gross pro®t margin for our FMCG business also increased by 7 percentage points due to lower raw material cost. On the other hand, gross pro®t margin for our cafeÂ business declined by 8 percentage points as a result of promotions for our new cafeÂ in Tsimshatsui. 51 FINANCIAL REVIEW G&A. G&A expenses declined by HK$0.6 million or 3% as compared with the same period in FY2000. The decrease was mainly attributable to the smaller provision made for bad debts because the actual write-offs incurred were less than provisions previously made. Other ad-hoc expenditure like legal fees, recruitment expenses and motorcar repairs also recorded minor reductions. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased by HK$5.4 million or 36% for the 6 months ended 30 June 2001 over the corresponding period in FY2000. The cafeÂ restaurant which opened in late June 2000 led to additional expenses of HK$2.6 million for the first half of FY2001. The following expenditure also increased in line with the increase in turnover:± (a) additional promotion expenses of approximately HK$1.0 million for the launch of the ready-to- drink products and approximately HK$1.0 million for listing fees to supermarkets and retail outlets as well as the various promotional activities for the enhancement of brand awareness and sales promotion to consumers; (b) additional spending of HK$0.2 million on market research and product development; (c) higher provision of HK$0.2 million for commissions payable to sales staff in line with our increase in sales; and (d) increased storage and delivery expenses to cope with higher inventory turnover. Operating pro®t. Our operating pro®t for the 6 months ended 30 June 2001 increased by 11% or HK$2.0 million being the result of higher turnover and better gross margins. With an additional cafeÂ in operation, our cafeÂ business generated pro®t of approximately HK$152,000 for the 6 months ended 30 June 2001, which was more than the pro®t of approximately HK$29,000 earned over the corresponding period in FY2000. Interest expenses. Interest expenses decreased by 59% because the interest rate on our bank borrowings were reduced several times in the ®rst half of FY2001 and because of our continued ability to maintain our borrowings at levels similar to the same period in FY2000. Other income. Other income decreased by HK$0.2 million due mainly to a decrease in interest income. The average balance of deposits placed with banks declined approximately by HK$2.6 million due mainly to the distribution of cash dividends to shareholders and the incidence of prepayments of fees and other expenses in relation to the Invitation. Pro®t before taxation. Pro®t before taxation for the 6 months ended 30 June 2001 was HK$20.4 million, which represents an increase of 12% or HK$2.2 million as compared with the corresponding period in FY2000. This was in line with the increase in turnover and gross pro®t margins. Pro®t before taxation attributable to our PRC operations declined by approximately HK$0.1 million as a result of the expansion of our representative of®ce in Guangzhou which led to higher staff costs and of®ce expenses. By business activities, our FMCG business segment moved from a loss of HK$0.7 million for the ®rst 6 months of FY2000 to HK$1.3 million for the ®rst 6 months of FY2001 due mainly to an increase in turnover arising from greater promotion efforts and progressively greater market acceptance of our products. This was, however, partially offset by losses incurred by new products such as our canned milk tea. REVIEW OF FINANCIAL POSITION Our operations have been ®nanced through a combination of shareholders' equity, retained earnings and external borrowings such as ®nance leases, trust receipts and short-term money market loans from ®nancial institutions. We have unutilised bank facilities, comprising bank overdrafts, term loan facilities and trade ®nance facilities, of approximately HK$50.3 million as at 30 June 2001. As such, our Directors are of the opinion that, after taking into account the present bank facilities and the net proceeds from the issue of the New Shares, we have adequate working capital for our present operating requirements. 52 FINANCIAL REVIEW As at 30 June 2001, our principal sources of liquidity included HK$27.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, mainly in HKD, and bank facilities of approximately HK$56.0 million of which HK$5.7 million, in trust receipts and bank overdrafts, has been utilised. These trust receipts loans and bank overdrafts are unsecured and are guaranteed by Wong Tat Tong, our Director, and Wong Sek Fook, Adviser to our Board. The trust receipts bear interest ranging from Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (``HIBOR'') plus 1.75% to HIBOR plus 2.5% per annum. The bank overdrafts bear interest rates ranging from Hong Kong Prime Rate (``Prime'') plus 0.125% to Prime plus 0.5%. After the listing of our Company, Wong Tat Tong and Wong Sek Fook intend to request our principal bankers to release them from their personal guarantees. Our Directors are of the view that the withdrawal of guarantees should not affect our existing banking facilities and our current cost of borrowings. A review of our ®nancial position over the last 3 ®nancial years and the 6 months ended 30 June 2001 is set out below:± Fixed assets From FY1998 to FY2000, we spent HK$21.3 million on the acquisition of ®xed assets, of which 45% or HK$9.5 million in aggregate were spent on plant and machinery so as to increase our production capacity to cope with business expansion. Despite this increase, the net book value of our ®xed assets increased marginally from HK$23.6 million as at 31 December 1998 to HK$24.4 million as at 31 December 2000 because of substantial write-offs during this period. In FY1998, a total net book value of coffee machines leased to customers in PRC of approximately HK$1.1 million was written off as a result of some customers ceasing operations during the Asian ®nancial crisis. In FY1999, 2 cafeÂ s in Hong Kong were closed down leading to a write-off of cafeÂ assets which amounted to HK$1.7 million. For FY2000, our ®xed assets increased from HK$20.7 million at the end of FY1999 to HK$24.4 million, representing an increase of 18% or HK$3.7 million. New ®xed assets amounting to HK$10.0 million were purchased during the year, of which HK$2.1 million was for the decoration of and equipment installed in our new cafeÂ restaurant, HK$1.1 million for production equipment for our production plants in Hong Kong and PRC, HK$3.0 million for coffee machines leased to catering customers, HK$1.0 million for the purchase of property in Canada for our operations and the remainder for the purchases of delivery trucks, computer equipment and of®ce furniture. This increase was partially offset by a depreciation charge of HK$4.8 million for the year, the transfer of second-hand coffee machines amounting to HK$1.1 million to inventory for subsequent sale to customers in PRC and an amount of HK$0.4 million arising mainly from the disposal of ®xed assets. Our ®xed assets decreased from HK$24.4 million at the end of FY2000 to HK$24.1 million as at 30 June 2001, representing a decrease of 1% or HK$0.3 million. We purchased new ®xed assets amounting to HK$2.8 million, of which HK$2.2 million was for coffee machines for sale and lease to customers, HK$0.4 million for computer equipment and the remainder for the purchases of delivery trucks and of®ce furniture. However, this increase was offset by the depreciation charge of HK$2.8 million for the period and the decrease in net book value of ®xed assets arising from the disposal of ®xed asset of HK$0.3 million. Current assets Current assets consist of mainly cash, trade receivables and inventory. Our current assets increased by HK$24.2 million from HK$75.6 million as at 31 December 1998 to HK$99.8 million as at 31 December 2000. To cope with the increased sales, we had to stock more inventory and extend more credit to our trade debtors, which increased by approximately HK$7.8 million and HK$5.5 million respectively from 31 December 1998 to 31 December 2000. As we have successfully generated pro®ts despite the Asian economic downturn and a large portion of these pro®ts have been realised into cash over the last 3 years, our cash balances grew strongly by HK$10.3 million. 53 FINANCIAL REVIEW During FY2000, our current assets increased by HK$12.1 million due mainly to an increase in our inventory levels to cope with our growth in sales. Our current assets increased by 10.5% or HK$10.5 million during the 6 months ended 30 June 2001. Our cash balances increased by HK$8.4 million over that of 31 December 2000 because of cash generated from operations during the ®rst half of FY2001 while our trade receivables increased marginally by HK$0.7 million or 2%. Our prepayments also included HK$5.2 million being interim payments of professional fees and other expenses in relation to the Invitation. Our inventories as at 30 June 2001 decreased by HK$4.8 million as compared to that as at 31 December 2000 due mainly to tighter inventory management policies being implemented at our PRC production facilities. Current liabilities Current liabilities consist of mainly trade and other payables, trust receipt loans and overdrafts, income tax payable, dividend payable and obligations under ®nance leases. From 31 December 1998 to 31 December 1999, our current liabilities decreased from HK$49.1 million to HK$40.4 million. This is because while increases in turnover and pro®ts resulted in higher creditor balances and increase in income tax payable, our strong cash position enabled us to reduce our reliance on trust receipt loans and overdrafts. Comparing our current liabilities as at 31 December 2000 with that as at 31 December 1999, we were able to reduce our current liabilities from approximately HK$40.4 million to approximately HK$36.4 million. Notwithstanding that we have slightly increased our bank borrowings from HK$2.1 million to HK$4.7 million, our strong cash position allowed us to reduce our trade payables and other payables by HK$5.2 million including the capitalisation of an advance of HK$3.8 million from Industria Colombiana de CafeÂ S.A. into equity shares of TW Investment. This amount was subsequently paid in November 2001. Our current liabilities increased by HK$7.8 million to HK$44.2 million as at 30 June 2001 from HK$36.4 million as at 31 December 2000 as we further reduced our payables to creditors given our continued strong cash position. Dividends in respect of FY2000 were also declared during the 6 months ended 30 June 2001 of which HK$12.8 million remain outstanding as at 30 June 2001. Non-current liabilities Non-current liabilities comprise obligations under ®nance leases. Non-current liabilities of HK$0.4 million in FY1998 were incurred as we entered into ®nance lease agreements for the purchase of delivery trucks. This subsequently decreased to HK$0.2 million due to the progressive repayment of ®nance lease creditors in FY1999. We had repaid all outstanding non-current liabilities by 31 December 2000. There was no non-current liabilities outstanding during the ®rst 6 months of FY2001. Shareholders' equity Shareholders' equity increased from HK$46.3 million as at 31 December 1998 to HK$76.2 million as at 31 December 2000, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 28.3%. The growth was mainly a result of the growth of our retained earnings from 31 December 1998 to 31 December 2000. Shareholders' equity further increased by HK$2.4 million as a result of pro®t generated of HK$17.3 during the ®rst 6 months of FY2001, less dividends of HK$14.9 million declared in respect of FY2000. 54 FINANCIAL REVIEW FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE Our sales are generally denominated in HKD although our sales to PRC, which account for approximately 10% of our total turnover, is denominated in RMB. Our purchases are denominated mainly in HKD and USD while RMB and other currencies generally account for less than 10% of our total purchases. As the HKD is currently pegged to the USD at a rate of approximately US$1 to HK$7.8, our exposure to ¯uctuations in USD is minimal. However, as our sales to PRC generally exceed the purchases from PRC, there is no natural hedge against ¯uctuations in RMB. We may, when necessary, enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against such ¯uctuations. Aside from this, we currently do not have any formal policy to hedge against foreign exchange exposure. A breakdown of our sales and purchases in HKD, USD, RMB and other currencies for FY2000 and the 6 months ended 30 June 2001 is set out below:± HKD USD RMB Others Total FY2000 Percentage of sales 89% Ð* 10% 1% 100% Percentage of purchases 68% 23% 5% 4% 100% 6 months ended 30 June 2001 Percentage of sales 89% Ð* 10% 1% 100% Percentage of purchases 65% 28% 3% 4% 100% * negligible Our foreign exchange loss over the last 3 ®nancial years from FY1998 to FY2000 and the 6 months ended 30 June 2001 is as follows:± FY1998 FY1999 FY2000 6 months ended 30 June 2001 Foreign exchange loss (HK$'000) 186 855 9 234 Percentage of turnover (%) 0.1 0.4 Ð* 0.2 Percentage of pro®t before taxation (%) 2.5 3.5 Ð* 1.1 * negligible 55 FINANCIAL REVIEW HISTORY Our Group was founded by Wong Keu in the early 1930s. At that time, our principal business was the wholesale of grocery products as well as coffee roasting and trading of coffee and tea. His son, Wong Sek Fook, joined the business in 1941 and the business was later incorporated in 1955 as Tsit Wing Coffee Company Limited (now known as TW Hong Kong). To cope with the rapid expansion of the business, we acquired a factory in Kowloon during the late 1960s to undertake the roasting and packaging of our coffee products. With the acquisition of the factory, we also began to undertake the blending of tea. The increased capacity of our own production plant allowed us to progressively capture a share of the Hong Kong catering market, namely, the processing, wholesaling and distribution business, which at that time included numerous individual Hong Kong style tea bistros and individual food outlets. In 1979, Wong Tat Tong, the grandson of our founder Wong Keu, was appointed as an Executive Director of the Tsit Wing Group. He is presently our Chairman and Managing Director. Recognising the potential of the catering business and the rapidly changing food and beverage market in Hong Kong, he directed our marketing efforts towards the hotels and fast food chains in Hong Kong. In 1980, we acquired and shifted to our present factory in Kwai Tak Industrial Centre in Kwai Chung, New Territories, and in the following year, we installed a computerised coffee processing line which was developed in the USA. This processing line with its fully automated control system, has the capacity to roast and package 420 kg of coffee per hour. We believe that we were the ®rst in Hong Kong to install such a processing line for roasting coffee. TW Coffee was incorporated in 1992 to undertake our trading of coffee, tea and canned products. It also serves as our purchasing arm and core manufacturing unit in Hong Kong. Today, we supply coffee and tea to fast food chains including McDonald's, KFC and Maxim's. Our fast food chain customers account for 9 of the 11 major fast food chains (that is, those that operate more than 10 outlets each) in Hong Kong. As our business expanded to become one of the leading tea and coffee suppliers, we also secured contracts to supply tea and coffee to many hotels in Hong Kong, including Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel & Towers, the Marco Polo group of hotels and Ritz-Carlton Hotel. Our hotel customers account for 34 of the 81 hotels in Hong Kong1 who are members of the Hong Kong Hotel Association. In 1994, we entered into the cafeÂ business with the incorporation of TW CafeÂ in Hong Kong. This allowed us to promote our products directly to consumers and helped to enhance the brand image of our Group. We currently operate 2 cafeÂ s under the name of ``TW CafeÂ '' in Central district on Hong Kong island and another cafeÂ under the name of ``CEO'' (short form for ``Coffee Expert Operator'') in Tsimshatsui, Kowloon. Realising the potential demand for coffee and tea in Canada by the growing Hong Kong Chinese community in Canada, in part due to the setting up of various businesses by Hong Kong businessmen there, we incorporated our wholly-owned subsidiary, TW Enterprises, in Canada in 1994 to distribute our products in Canada. In addition, during 1994, we set up our PRC joint venture, TW Zhuhai. TW Zhuhai currently engages in coffee processing, including the roasting of coffee beans and the packaging of instant All-In-One coffee and tea mix products. TW Zhuhai also undertakes our catering supply business to hotels and fast food chain customers in PRC. Since 1994, TW Zhuhai has been expanding its business network in PRC and has captured a signi®cant market presence in various cities through the setting up of various regional of®ces in major cities in PRC, including Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. We currently cater to more than 800 hotels, fast food chains and food establishments in these cities in PRC. We also cater to 7 out of the approximately 24 domestic airlines operating in PRC. 1 Source : Membership list of the Hong Kong Hotel Association updated as at 12 June 2001 (downloaded from http:// www.hktourismboard.com/hkha). 56 GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP In late 1997, we entered the FMCG market in PRC with the launch of our 3-In-1 coffee. In the following year, we introduced the All-In-One coffee series in Hong Kong after a series of advertising and promotion activities which included television commercials and print advertising. Shortly after, we also introduced the All-In-One Milk Tea series and the 3-in-1 Milk Tea series to cater to a wider base of consumers in our primary markets of Hong Kong and PRC respectively. In 1998, our Hong Kong coffee processing line was accredited with the Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Point (``HACCP'') certi®cate. The HACCP certi®cate was awarded to us as we met the stringent requirements of McDonald's restaurants, which is one of the largest fast food chains in the world. Our range of products expanded further in 1999 with the introduction of our All-In-One Yuan Yang which is a mixture of coffee and tea. During the year, we also tried to venture into the cafeÂ business in PRC through Beijing Tsit Wing CafeÂ Shop Co., Ltd which was subsequently voluntarily liquidated as the cafeÂ operation was not viable. In 1999, we restructured our investment in TW Zhuhai when we invited a new investor, Industria Colombiana de CafeÂ S.A., to participate in TW Zhuhai. In conjunction with this, our shareholding interest in TW Zhuhai, held through Tsit Wing China (BVI), was increased from 70% to 90%. Subsequently, the entire 90% holding in TW Zhuhai of Tsit Wing China (BVI) was transferred to TW Investment. Tsit Wing China (BVI) was subsequently voluntarily liquidated as part of the Restructuring Exercise. Zhuhai Hua Sheng holds the remaining 10% interest in TW Zhuhai and Industria Colombiana de CafeÂ S.A. holds a 17% interest in TW Investment. The other shareholders of TW Investment are set out on pages 42 and 43 of this Prospectus. As part of the terms of the restructuring, Zhuhai Hua Sheng will receive a guaranteed payment but will not be entitled to any share of pro®ts of TW Zhuhai or be liable for any losses or liabilities of TW Zhuhai for a period of 5 years expiring in December 2004. TW Investment therefore accounts for TW Zhuhai as its wholly- owned subsidiary. In April 2000, we launched our ®rst ready-to-drink product, TW canned coffee, to enter the growing market for ready-to-drink products in the FMCG market in Hong Kong. In February 2001, we successfully entered the international airline market by supplying 3-in-1 milk tea to selected routes of Cathay Paci®c Airways. In March 2001, we launched our second ready-to-drink product, TW canned milk tea, in the FMCG market in Hong Kong. In March 2001, we also started an alliance with 7-eleven convenience stores in Hong Kong to establish ``TW Coffee and Tea Stations'' to provide freshly brewed TW coffee and tea to customers who patronise these 7-eleven convenience stores. In May 2001, we secured a contract to supply gourmet coffees such as Jamaica Blue Mountain and Colombia Supremo to Singapore Airlines. In addition, we are co-operating with Park'N Shop and Wellcome, which are 2 established supermarket chains in Hong Kong, by setting up ``TW Coffee Concept'' counters, to provide one- stop coffee buying services to customers at their high traf®c outlets. Our objective in establishing these alliances with 7-eleven, Park'N Shop and Wellcome is to expand our domestic retail coffee business in Hong Kong and to further develop our brand name. Today, with our track record of almost 70 years and our experienced management team, we have established ourselves as one of the leaders in the tea and coffee catering business in Hong Kong, supplying to approximately 4,800 food establishments such as hotels, restaurants and fast food chains, which account for over 80% of the F&B outlets in Hong Kong. We have also established a signi®cant presence in the catering business in the PRC market. We believe that our expansion into the FMCG and cafeÂ business will help to broaden our range of activities as well as to build our brand name in the F&B industry in our primary markets. 57 GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP BUSINESS Our principal business activities are processing, wholesaling and distribution of F&B products, mainly tea and coffee, in our primary markets of Hong Kong, PRC and Canada. We import, process and blend, and pack our coffee and tea products at our production facilities in Hong Kong and PRC. With our own processing plants and marketing efforts, we have built up an established market in the catering business, that is, the wholesaling and distribution of tea and coffee supplies to food establishments like hotels, restaurants and fast food chains. We also distribute and supply related accessories and products such as coffee machines, and grocery items like butter, sugar, creamer and evaporated milk, to provide the convenience of one-stop purchasing for our customers. At present, our FMCG and cafeÂ businesses are relatively small, contributing approximately 10% in aggregate to our total turnover, as we entered into these businesses gradually over the last 7 years. Our objective of getting into the FMCG and cafeÂ businesses is to broaden our range of activities and to build our brand name in the F&B industry in our primary markets. In the FMCG market, we distribute mainly our own TW brand All-In-One Instant Coffee and Milk Tea products, roasted and ground coffee, ready-to-drink canned coffee and canned milk tea. In the cafeÂ business, we presently operate 3 cafeÂ s in Hong Kong. In our efforts to build our TW brand name internationally, we participate in international food exhibitions every year, such as the Asian International Exhibition of Hotel, Restaurant, Retail and Catering Equipment, Supplies and Services, Food and Drink (also known as Hofex), Hong Kong International Products Exhibition and Food Expo. We also participated in overseas exhibitions such as Food and Hotel Asia in Singapore in 2000. Our Chairman and Managing Director, Wong Tat Tong, has made presentations at the World Specialty Coffee Conference & Exhibition in Tokyo, Japan in 1999 as well as the Asia International Coffee Conference in Singapore and Thailand in 2000. Catering Business Catering is our core business segment and currently accounts for approximately 90% of our total turnover. We supply coffee and tea products to established hotels, restaurants and fast food chains in our primary markets of Hong Kong, PRC and Canada. We also customise different blends of coffee and tea to these customers to suit their requirements in terms of satisfying the taste and preferences of their customers. This enables the F&B establishments to provide unique blends to their customers and hence build and retain their regular pool of customers. Our product strategy in the catering business is to deliver a complete range of services to our customers. In this respect, we:± . carry out research and development on behalf of our customers to develop products that are customised to meet their speci®c requirements; . provide training for our new customers that are caterers, on the techniques of brewing and preparing coffee and tea to serve their consumers; . provide portion packing services to assist customers in standardising the taste and simplifying the process of preparing coffee and tea; . supply complementary products such as butter, sugar and other related grocery items so as to enable our customers to enjoy the convenience of a one-stop purchase; . source and lease coffee brewing machines to our customers; . provide deliveries to our customers within 24 hours so as to enable our customers to reduce their cost of holding inventory and to have the assurance that stocks are readily available; and . provide after-sales services such as ®ne-tuning the blend of our coffee and tea to meet changing consumer taste, and general repair and maintenance of coffee machines. 58 GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP Hong Kong Of the 5,9281 F&B outlets in Hong Kong (excluding Chinese restaurants which generally do not serve coffee), we currently cater to approximately 4,800 outlets, which include fast food chains, restaurants and other food establishments.

The grocery products that we distribute include butter, sugar, creamer and evaporated milk. We also distribute equipment such as Rex-Royal coffee machines. In February 2001, we successfully entered the international airline market by supplying 3-in-1 instant milk tea to selected routes of Cathay Paci®c Airways. Following that, in May 2001, we secured a contract to supply gourmet coffees such as Jamaica Blue Mountain and Colombia Supremo to Singapore Airlines. 1 Source : Employment & Vacancies Statistics 2000 Ð Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, PRC. 2 All the major fast food accounts have at least 10 outlets each except for Nine to Five which operates 6 outlets in Hong Kong. 59 GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP PRC While our catering business in PRC is relatively less mature than in Hong Kong, we have successfully secured catering contracts with a number of hotels and fast food chains, including all the McDonald's outlets in Guangdong and Sichuan numbering more than 100 outlets. Our catering portfolio in the PRC market also includes 7 domestic airlines. Our major customers in PRC are as follows:± Major Catering Accounts Regions/Cities 1.

So®tel Jinan Jinan As the PRC market is geographically more widespread than the Hong Kong market, we have set up a regional sales and distribution of®ce in each of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Wuhan to cover major cities and special economic zones in PRC. These include:± Regions Areas Southern Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai and other Guangdong areas Northern Beijing, Dalian and surrounding areas Eastern Shanghai and surrounding areas Central Wuhan, Sichuan and surrounding areas Although our tea and coffee products have an average life span of 2 years and 1 year respectively, they are still considered to be perishable products. Hence, we rely on our distributors in PRC to deliver our products on a timely basis in order to ensure the freshness of our products. To date, we have not encountered any interruption in delivery which had a signi®cant impact on our operations. However, we have no control over our distributors and hence cannot ensure that such interruption will not occur in the future. Further details are set out in the section under the heading ``Risk Factors'' on page 23 of this Prospectus. Canada We started our catering business in Canada in 1994. Currently, we cater mainly to Hong Kong style tea bistros which are operated by Chinese immigrants in Canada. These are located in various cities in Canada, including Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. Fast Moving Consumer Goods Business We are relatively new in the FMCG market having only entered this business segment in PRC in 1997 and in Hong Kong in 1998. Despite being a new entrant, our market share has been increasing and we have been ranked third in terms of sales value and sales volume of coffee mix sold in Hong Kong,1 behind established brands like NescafeÂ and Maxwell House. 1 Source : ACNielsen Retail Services (Coffee Mix) January ± October 2001. Surveys are conducted by ACNielsen who furnishes reports on the results of the surveys to us on a bi-monthly basis. 60 GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP Our FMCG products are distributed in Hong Kong through various supermarket chains, convenience stores and department stores. These include established chains such as Wellcome and Park'N Shop as well as 7-eleven convenience stores which are located throughout Hong Kong and Daily Stop stores which are located in most Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway (``MTR'') stations. The following products are available in Hong Kong:± . TW All-In-One Coffee series available in Colombian, Sumiyaki and Mocha blends; .

Like our catering business segment in Hong Kong, our sales and marketing team is in charge of the sales and marketing of our FMCG products for distribution in Hong Kong. We actively advertise and promote our FMCG products through a variety of media, including television and print advertising. We have established our presence in the FMCG business in PRC covering the same major regions as our catering business. We appoint distributors to assist us in providing logistics support to serve our customers in various regions while our sales and marketing staff are responsible for account management and conducting advertising and promotion activities. Our products are available in Carrefour, Makro and other hyper-marts, supermarkets, convenience stores and department stores in PRC. To cater to the taste of the consumer in PRC, we distribute the following products in PRC:± . TW All-In-One Coffee series available in Colombian and Sumiyaki blends; .

In addition, we have established TW Australia as a liaison of®ce to market our products in Australia and to source for Australian products for distribution to our customers in Hong Kong. We do not expect any signi®cant contribution from TW Australia to our results in the short-term. CafeÂ Business In order to promote our products and our brand name, we have established 3 cafeÂ s in Hong Kong, at Queen Victoria Street and Capitol Plaza, both in Central, Hong Kong, and at Nathan Road in Tsimshatsui, Kowloon. The cafeÂ at Nathan Road is a coffee specialty restaurant and is the largest of our 3 cafeÂ s. The cafeÂ s in Central, Hong Kong serve light snacks and beverages while the cafeÂ at Nathan Road serves western style meals such as pasta and barbequed ribs. We serve our TW coffee and tea products at all these cafeÂ s. These cafeÂ s promote our own TW brand products and also help to build brand awareness of our TW name to the end consumers. We believe that, to some extent, cafeÂ s are an effective tool in promoting awareness of the coffee and tea drinking culture. We intend to strengthen our foothold in the cafeÂ business and to build this up into another of our core businesses. Further details of our future plans in this business are set out in the section under the heading ``Business Strategies and Future Plans'' on page 83 of this Prospectus. 61 GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP PROCESSING OPERATIONS All our tea and coffee products are processed at our own production facilities in Hong Kong and PRC, except for our TW canned coffee and canned milk tea which are packed by contract manufacturers in Thailand. Our production plants undertake the processing of the following products:± . Roasted and Ground Coffee; . Blended Tea; . TW All-In-One Coffee; . TW All-In-One Milk Tea; and . TW All-In-One Yuan Yang.

These two plants give the combined capacity to produce up to 1,680,000 kg of coffee, 1,540,000 kg of tea and 270,000 kg of instant beverage products per annum. Our Hong Kong production plant is approximately 7,768 sq ft in ¯oor space and consists of 2 coffee roasting processing lines and 2 tea blending processing lines. Each coffee processing line comprises a coffee roasting system, coffee grinders, automatic and semi-automatic packing machines which were imported from countries including USA, Germany, Japan, Italy and Austria.

Our production facilities practise HACCP and Good Manufacturing Practice (``GMP'') standards. Under HACCP, we are required to exercise and maintain 5 critical control points to ensure that all contaminants are removed in our production process. We maintain high standards of quality control and hygiene to ensure that only quality products are produced from our production facilities. 62 GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP The production of our TW canned coffee and milk tea is contracted to a producer in Thailand. We supply the blending recipes to this producer and impose stringent levels of quality controls on the production process. Our bottled instant soluble coffee is imported from South America and marketed under the manufacturers' labels. For canned coffee and milk tea drinks, inspections are carried out at regular intervals by both the producer and ourselves as part of quality control measures required under the contract. In addition, our Quality Assurance team makes regular inspection visits to the producer's plant to monitor physical, chemical and microbiological analysis so as to ensure that our products meet the required standards for canned beverages. 63 GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP Coffee Production The following ¯ow chart outlines the production process of our coffee products:± Raw Coffee Beans Material Selection Cleaning Blending Roasting Quenching Cooling De-stoning Grinding Ground Coffee Packing Product Incoming Quality Control Size, moisture content, cup taste CCP I.

To ensure that only quality products are produced in our manufacturing plants, we place great emphasis on the selection of green coffee beans for our products. We perform analysis on beans samples provided by new suppliers. Requirements such as moisture, size and quality have to be met before shipment is effected. Our quality control division also performs such analysis on samples from our regular suppliers from time to time to ensure that the quality of our raw materials is not compromised. Production After analysis and selection of the green coffee beans, they are vacuum-cleaned to remove any foreign material which may contaminate the beans. They will then be directed into bean silos for storage until they are ready to be blended. Our existing line is fully automated and allows blending of up to 6 types of beans. Different coffee recipes are blended to meet the requirements and taste of our customers. After blending, the green beans are roasted and quenched. This roasting process removes all microbiological contamination to the beans. The quenching process is a rapid cooling process after roasting. The beans also undergo a de-stoning process which removes foreign materials from the roasted beans. After the roasted beans are cooled, they are either stored in bean form or processed further in a grinder to form ground coffee powder. The roasted beans or ground coffee powder are then packed for delivery to our customers. Our quality control team conducts regular checks on variables such as the roasting temperatures and blending weights to ensure compliance with our customers' requirements. Packing While standard packaging is immediately available, we are able to customise our packaging according to our customers' speci®cations. Our fully automated packing equipment allows us to pack our coffee products in different sizes ranging from a 2 oz pack to a 10 lbs pack to meet the varying demands of our clients. Different types of packaging such as laminated aluminium foil or ®lter paper are available. The laminated aluminium foil packaging may be ®tted with a de-gassing valve to enhance freshness by allowing a one-way out¯ow of biogas released from the coffee. The types of packaging are important as they would affect the shelf life of the products. For instance, vacuum packing gives the product a shelf life of up to 12 months while ®lter bags are usually used to pack products for immediate consumption, such as those used for airline catering. 65 GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP Tea Production The following ¯ow chart outlines the production process of our tea products:± Raw Tea Leaves Material Selection Sieve Cleaning Blending Packing Product Incoming Quality Control Size, colour, cup taste Material Lot Control FPQC Checkpoint - Packing, weighing, cup taste Storage, shelf life control FPQC — Final Product Quality Control Material Selection Our raw tea leaves are imported mainly from suppliers in Sri Lanka. Similar to our green coffee beans, raw tea leaves are also subject to stringent analysis. Factors such as the size and colour of the leaves are analysed before production commences. Samples provided by new suppliers are analysed and only accepted when the desired results are obtained. Our quality control division also carries out checks on samples from our regular suppliers to ensure that the quality of tea leaves is not compromised. Production The production of tea involves cleaning of the leaves by passing them through a sieve to remove foreign material contaminants. The tea leaves are then blended according to the requirements of our customers. Our quality control team also performs regular checks throughout our blending process to ensure that the desired taste is achieved. Packing Our tea packing line allows us to pack our tea in bags of different sizes ranging from 2 oz to 10 lbs bags and different types of packaging are also available. 66 GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP All-In-One Beverage Mix The following ¯ow chart outlines the production process of our All-In-One coffee, tea and yuan yang products (collectively referred to as ``All-In-One Beverage Mix'' products).

Raw materials used in the production are instant coffee and tea powder, creamer and sugar. These materials are imported mainly from countries such as Brazil and Colombia for coffee and Sri Lanka for tea while non-dairy creamer is imported mainly from Europe. These materials are then blended according to various blending recipes to produce the ®nal All-In-One Beverage Mix products. Raw materials delivered to our Zhuhai production plant are subject to thorough inspection before production. The raw materials are unpacked in clean rooms and sterilised with Ultra-Violet (UV) light to remove any microbiological contamination. Production is carried out in clean and humidity controlled rooms and all production staff are required to wear protective clothing to ensure that products are free from contaminants. Completed products are then packed in sachets and boxes, ready for export to the Hong Kong market or for distribution in PRC. SALES AND MARKETING Our sales and marketing functions are headed by our 2 Senior Sales Managers and a Marketing Manager respectively. For our catering business in Hong Kong, we do not employ any third party distributors. Instead our sales and marketing team undertakes all direct sales to our customers. This ensures that our sales team works closely with the customers and is able to cater to their speci®c requirements. In PRC, 67 GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP we appoint distributors to facilitate the distribution of our products. These distributors not only undertake invoicing, logistics and delivery to our customers but also grant credit terms to the customers and hence streamline our collection process. For major regions such as Beijing and Shanghai, we appoint different distributors for different market segments to reduce our reliance on a single distributor. While stock distribution and other logistics functions are delegated to our distributors, account management as well as advertising and promotion activities are undertaken by our sales and marketing team. Our marketing section consists of a team of 7 marketing of®cers who plan and execute marketing strategies in Hong Kong and PRC. The main functions of our marketing team include product management, product development and market research. Our marketing team is also responsible for corporate relations and marketing communications activities such as directing advertising agencies in the production of television commercials, media advertising planning, coordinating sales promotions with our sales team and organising exhibitions. Our sales section comprises more than 20 sales staff and they are grouped under 5 divisions as follows:± . Hong Kong Island division; . Kowloon division; . New Territories division; . Hotel and Institution division; and . FMCG division. The Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and New Territories divisions are responsible for catering sales to Hong Kong style tea bistros and other individual food outlets, while sales staff from the Hotel and Institution division and the FMCG division specialise in handling sales and customer services in their respective sectors. The main functions of the 5 sales divisions are to explore new business opportunities, conduct product training for our customers and maintain good business relationships with our customers. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Our research and development (``R&D'') activities are undertaken by the R&D unit of our production department under the guidance of our Managing Director, Wong Tat Tong, and our Management Committee comprising division heads from our sales, marketing, purchasing and production departments. Our R&D unit currently comprises 3 employees in Hong Kong and 2 in PRC. These employees have quali®cations in food science or chemical engineering and/or have many years of experience in the F&B industry. Customised blends of coffee and tea are developed in close co- operation with our customers. Blends with different aroma, richness and taste characteristics are developed to suit the patrons of our customers' F&B outlets. We are also constantly working with our catering customers to develop new products and to improve existing ones. Aside from developing blends for our customers, we also work towards designing and developing appropriate types of packaging for our customers. Packaging may range from aluminium foil bags to ®lter bag-type packaging depending on our customers' requirements. Suitable size packaging is recommended to individual customers after taking into consideration the type of food establishment they operate and the equipment they use. The analysis of market trends and the changing taste of consumers as well as the assessment of marketability and growth of new and existing products locally and internationally are undertaken by our R&D unit. Our R&D expenditure, which comprises mainly the salaries and other related costs of our full-time R&D staff, has been insigni®cant for the past 3 ®nancial years and for the 6 months ended 30 June 2001. 68 GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP TRADEMARKS We have ®led applications for trademark registration for the following trademarks:± Trademark Class Country Status 30 Hong Kong and PRC Registered 30 Hong Kong Registered 30 and 42 Hong Kong Registered 29 30 29, 30 and 32 30 PRC PRC, Canada and Sri Lanka Australia Hong Kong and USA Registered Registered Registered Pending 30 Canada Registered 30 30 Canada Hong Kong Registered Pending 30 Canada Registered 69 GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP Trademark Class Country Status 30 Canada and USA Registered TW Enterprises 30 Canada Registered TW Canada 30 Canada Registered 30 Hong Kong Registered 30 Canada Registered 30 Canada Registered 30 Hong Kong Registered 29 30 Hong Kong Hong Kong, Canada and Sri Lanka Registered Registered 29 and 30 Hong Kong Registered 29 30 Hong Kong Hong Kong, Canada and Sri Lanka Registered Registered 70 GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP Trademark Class Country Status 30 Hong Kong and Sri Lanka Registered 30 Canada Registered 30 Hong Kong Pending 30 Hong Kong Pending 30 Hong Kong Pending 30 Hong Kong Pending 30 Canada Registered 30 30 Canada Hong Kong and PRC Registered Pending 30 Hong Kong Pending 30 Canada Registered 71 GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP Trademark Class Country Status 30 30 Canada Hong Kong and PRC Registered Pending 30 Hong Kong Registered 30 Hong Kong Pending 30 Canada Registered 30 Hong Kong Pending TASTEWISE 29 and 30 Hong Kong Pending 29 and 30 Hong Kong Pending 30 Canada Registered 30 Canada Registered 30 Canada Registered 72 GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP Trademark Class Country Status 30 Canada Pending 30 Canada Pending 30 Canada Pending COMPETITION Catering Our main competitors in the catering business in Hong Kong range from small to medium sized individual coffee roasters and tea distributors to international coffee and tea companies such as Edward Keller Ltd for Melitta coffee, BoncafeÂ (Far East) Ltd for BoncafeÂ coffee, Hiang Kie HK Ltd for coffee and Tai Luen Coffee Co Ltd for both coffee and tea. In Hong Kong, there are approximately 15 individual coffee roasters with whom we compete directly for the supply of coffee, tea and other grocery products to Hong Kong style tea bistros. In this market, there are 5,928 F&B outlets in Hong Kong1 and we are currently actively supplying to approximately 4,800 of them. This amounts to a market share of over 80%.

We currently supply to 34 of the 81 hotels2 who are members of the Hong Kong Hotel Association and 9 of the 11 major fast food chains that operate more than 10 outlets each in Hong Kong. In PRC, we face competition from internationally recognised brands such as Melitta, BoncafeÂ , Milan Gold, Arabic Roaster and Starbucks as well as local coffee producers from provinces such as Yunnan and Hainan in the catering of coffee and tea to the hotel segment in PRC. We compete with NestleÂ in the airline catering segment. We currently cater to more than 800 hotels, fast food chains and food establishments in the major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou and Shenzhen in PRC. We also cater to 7 domestic airlines in PRC out of approximately 24 domestic airlines. FMCG The FMCG markets in Hong Kong and PRC are currently dominated by our major competitors, including NestleÂ and Maxwell House who have been in this market for many years. Nevertheless, despite our short track record of approximately 4 years in the FMCG market, we have been ranked third in terms of sales value and sales volume of coffee mix sold in the Hong Kong market as evidenced by market surveys conducted by ACNielsen, an international market research company3. 1 Source : Employment & Vacancies Statistics 2000 - Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, PRC.

We strive to achieve consistency in taste and packaging to meet the speci®c requirements of each of our customers. To achieve this, our roasting and blending process is fully computerised to ensure that our products are produced in accordance with customers' speci®cations. In addition, our production department has developed quality control procedures to ensure that our products are free from contaminants and defects. As testimony to our commitment to quality, our coffee processing operations in Hong Kong were accredited with the HACCP certi®cate by McDonald's chain of restaurants in 1998. Comprehensive Logistic Support We are committed to prompt delivery of our products to all our customers. In Hong Kong, we undertake all logistics functions, from receiving to delivery, in-house. We operate a fully integrated computer system which handles inventory and customers' orders. This system streamlines our inventory handling and reduces the lead time for distribution. We have a dedicated team of delivery staff and a ¯eet of more than 10 delivery trucks which provide prompt and reliable delivery service to customers throughout Hong Kong within 24 hours. We appoint various distributors in the major regions of PRC to undertake the logistics functions of our operations there. These distributors are carefully selected and closely monitored to ensure that they are able to deliver high levels of customer service, including timely and reliable delivery, to our PRC customers. Wide Range of FMCG Products We have developed and launched a wide range of products in the FMCG market. Currently we have over 20 products ranging from roasted and ground coffee to instant tea and coffee beverages and, recently, canned coffee and milk tea. These products are sold through supermarkets, convenience stores and department stores throughout Hong Kong and in major cities in PRC. Despite being a new entrant with approximately 4 years of track record, our market share has been increasing and we have been ranked third in terms of sales value and sales volume of coffee mix sold in Hong Kong,1 behind established brands like NescafeÂ and Maxwell House. Good Relationship with Suppliers We have good working relationships with our suppliers. We have been trading with our international suppliers such as Mitsui & Co (H.K.) Ltd, Unilever Hong Kong Limited and Federacion Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia for over 12 years. We therefore believe that we can be assured of a regular and reliable source of raw materials from them. 1 Source : ACNielsen Retail Services (Coffee Mix) January ± October 2001.

Our cafeÂ s in Central Hong Kong operate under the Light Refreshment Restaurant Licence while our newly opened cafeÂ in Tsimshatsui operates under the General Restaurant Licence. The licences are valid for one year and are renewable annually. The FEHD will conduct random inspections on our premises to ensure that we are in compliance with the required regulations. The grant and renewal of the licence is at the discretion of the FEHD. The licence may be suspended, revoked and cancelled at any time by the FEHD upon breach of any restriction or condition subject to which the licence was granted, or in the event of any contravention of the provisions of the PHMSO or any regulations made thereunder. 75 GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP (b) The Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, Chapter 109 of Hong Kong requires that a liquor licence be obtained from the Liquor Licensing Board for the sale of liquor on the premises.

EMPLOYEES As at 30 June 2001, we have a workforce of 269 full-time employees of which 64% are employed in Hong Kong and the remaining based in PRC, Canada and Australia. None of our employees are unionised. The relationship and cooperation between our management and staff have been good. There has not been any incidence of work stoppages or labour disputes which affected our operations. The average number of our full-time employees in each of the past 3 ®nancial years and the 6 months ended 30 June 2001 are as follows:± FY1998 FY1999 FY2000 6 months ended 30 June 2001 Average number of employees 222 245 258 266 Employee turnover(1) 32% 28% 22% 11% Note:± (1) Percentage of employee turnover is computed as total resignations during the period divided by the average number of employees in that period (that is, the average of the number of employees at the beginning of the period and at the end of the period). The geographical and functional distribution of our full-time employees as at 30 June 2001 are as follows:± Function Hong Kong PRC Canada Australia Total Management 6 Ð 2 2 10 Administration and Finance 16 39 2 Ð 57 Sales and Distribution 127 23 Ð Ð 150 Production 22 30 Ð Ð 52 171 92 4 2 269 80 GENERAL INFORMATION ON OUR GROUP PROSPECTS Coffee and tea are our main products. Besides expanding in our primary markets of Hong Kong and PRC, we target to expand to the South-East Asian countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Vietnam. We believe that the long-term prospects for coffee and tea consumption in Asia, including Hong Kong and PRC, are good so long as coffee and tea remain as the key beverages of consumers. We believe that the demand for our tea products is underpinned by the demand in Hong Kong and PRC which traditionally have a tea-drinking culture. Sales of tea constituted approximately 51% of our catering sales in FY2000. In particular, we believe that there is growth potential for black tea in PRC with western in¯uences shifting consumer preference from Chinese tea to black tea. This trend is already emerging as we have observed the rapid development of Hong Kong style tea bistros in the past 2 years, concentrating ®rst in the Pearl River Delta region and spreading to the more developed cities in PRC such as Shanghai and Beijing. In addition, industry research has estimated a 20.0% annual growth in coffee demand in PRC for 2001 over 2000. This growth compares favourably with the global coffee consumption growth of 2.8%. In South-East Asia, countries such as Thailand (7.7%), Indonesia (9.5%) and Vietnam (8.4%) have also seen similar favourable growth1. With the potential growth in demand for coffee in Asia, we expect keen competition from international coffee roasters in this market. However, our strength as an Asian based company is our knowledge of the Asian culture and our business network in Asia. We could also be the partner of choice for these international coffee roasters who may wish to venture into this business in Asia. We therefore see opportunities for us to grow in Asia and to be the choice partner for potential strategic investors in Asia. In the short-term, our performance could be subject to the economic conditions of our primary markets in Hong Kong and PRC as a slowdown in economic conditions in these markets could affect consumers' spending patterns and therefore could have a negative impact on the demand for our products. Furthermore, the 11 September incident in the USA, the current war in Afghanistan and the threat of future terrorist attacks have resulted in considerable political and economic uncertainties in many parts of the world. The airline industry, in which we have plans to further expand into, is also signi®cantly affected by a decline in air travel. However, our current primary focus in the airline segment is on domestic airlines in China which we believe are less signi®cantly affected than the international airlines. However, in the long-term, we believe that we are well positioned to tap the growth potential in coffee and tea consumption in the Asian region. In addition, with PRC's entry to the WTO, we believe that potential tariff cuts for agricultural products, including coffee beans and tea leaves, will reduce our import costs for these raw materials in PRC. We also anticipate the establishment of more western food and coffee lifestyle outlets in PRC in the future. The in¯ux of such outlets is expected to create a greater demand for coffee and raise the pro®le of the coffee drinking lifestyle in PRC. 1 Source : Neumann Kaffee Gruppe Statistical Unit Quarterly Report (Quarter I-II 2001). 81 PROSPECTS, BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND FUTURE PLANS BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND FUTURE PLANS Our business strategies to propel our future growth will focus on expanding our existing businesses. We have developed the following future plans:± Expand our Catering Business We currently cater to more than 80% of the F&B establishments in Hong Kong, including Hong Kong style tea bistros, hotels and fast food chains. However, we are of the view that there are still areas for expansion in our catering business as explained below. In Hong Kong, we currently cater to approximately 42% of the 81 hotels in Hong Kong who are members of the Hong Kong Hotel Association1. In this respect, we intend to extend our reach to more hotels in Hong Kong. In line with our strategy to eventually be a major supplier in the catering market for a wide range of grocery products, we have begun to place emphasis on our distribution of grocery products in Hong Kong. We are diversifying into the distribution of grocery products as an additional ``one-stop'' shop for our customers and also to build up our own private labels for grocery products. Currently, evaporated milk, butter, tuna, sugar and chicken seasoning are some of the grocery products which we contract out to third parties to produce under our own private labels, some of which are set out in the section under the heading ``Trademarks'' on pages 69 to 73 of this Prospectus. In PRC, our Directors are of the view that we can achieve further penetration in the catering business in the hotel and airline segments as our business involvement in PRC is relatively recent. In the hotel segment, we currently cater to 120 hotels in PRC. We estimate that there are at least another 300 hotels in selected cities in PRC which we would like to target as our customers. In the airline segment, we currently cater to 7 domestic airlines. We estimate that there is a total of 24 domestic airlines in PRC. Expand our FMCG Business The FMCG business is a new business activity which we ventured into in 1997. Our presence in the FMCG market not only provides us with an additional revenue source but also improves and enhances our branding and image. We are constantly developing and launching new FMCG products under our private labels to cater to the varying taste of our customers. Following the introduction of our coffee and tea products in the FMCG market, we intend to extend our product lines to include other canned beverages. We also see opportunities in the contract manufacturing business, that is, produce for customers under their brand names. For instance, we produce 3-in-1 milk tea for Park'N Shop. Although the products in the contract manufacturing business may be similar to those under our own private label, we believe that there is no cannibalism of our brands as the products are produced to the taste and preferences of our customers and is unique to each of our customers. On the contrary, the contract manufacturing business is a means of maintaining our relationship with our customers and provides us with an additional source of revenue. Moreover, such contract manufacturing business contributes to better utilisation of our production facilities for our FMCG products. To further develop our FMCG market, we introduced the ``TW Coffee Concept'' counters in supermarket chains and we intend to continue our expansion in this area. The ``TW Coffee Concept'' counters provides customers with a ``one-stop'' service in coffee shopping. These ``TW Coffee Concept'' counters also allow customers to blend the coffee according to their taste. Customers will thus have the satisfaction of purchasing freshly ground coffee at one convenient stop at the supermarket. We have also recently, in March 2001, set up ``TW Coffee and Tea Stations'' at 7- eleven convenience stores to make our products readily available and accessible to consumers. 1 Source : Membership list of the Hong Kong Hotel Association updated as at 12 June 2001 (downloaded from http:// www.hktourismboard.com/hkha). 82 PROSPECTS, BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND FUTURE PLANS Consumers can purchase freshly brewed coffee and tea at these stations at the press of a button. At present, we have 5 ``TW Coffee Concept'' counters in Park'N Shop and Wellcome and over 100 ``TW Coffee and Tea Stations'' in 7-eleven stores. We also aim to introduce the ``TW Coffee Concept'' counters to other supermarket and convenience store chains. Enhance Production Capacity, Ef®ciency and Quality Assurance To support our expansion plans in our catering business, we plan to enhance our production ef®ciency by acquiring new machinery and upgrading our existing production line over the next 2 years. In this respect, we intend to install a new coffee processing line which includes a 120 kg per batch coffee roaster, a packaging line for vacuum brick packing catering to the FMCG market (which is able to prolong the freshness of the products) and an air-conveyor delivery system for the transportation of the roasted coffee beans and ground coffee. We also intend to upgrade our computerised control system which enables the monitoring and recording of data variables such as weight and moisture content to improve our control of the production process. In PRC, we intend to install a tea blending system to increase our current tea production capacity. To cater for our expansion in Hong Kong, we have leased with effect from 1 July 2001 an additional 6,814 sq ft of ¯oor space in Kwai Tak Industrial Centre where our existing operations are located. This will increase our current warehouse space from approximately 48,000 sq ft to 54,800 sq ft. In line with the changes in taste and preferences of beverage consumers, there is also a need to strengthen our R&D capabilities to improve our production processes, product development and quality assurance. In this regard, we intend to upgrade our laboratory facilities to enable us to undertake more testing in-house instead of outsourcing them to third parties. We estimate that the capital expenditure required for the above production capacity expansion to be approximately HK$27.0 million, of which HK$21.0 million is intended to be funded from the net proceeds from the Invitation and the balance of HK$6.0 million will be from our internal resources and/or bank borrowings. Develop our CafeÂ Business At present, we have 3 cafeÂ s located in the Central and Tsimshatsui areas in Hong Kong, the cafeÂ at Tsimshatsui being a restaurant style outlet. We intend to further expand our network of cafeÂ s and restaurants in Hong Kong and to set up new outlets in PRC. We believe that the presence of our cafeÂ s will enhance our brand name and image and create an awareness of the tea and coffee culture. With the emerging trend of such western style cafeÂ s as a lifestyle statement in Asia, we see the cafeÂ business in Hong Kong and PRC as a potential growth market that is relatively untapped. We are also in negotiations with strategic partners to set up joint ventures to operate cafeÂ s in Hong Kong and PRC. In addition, we have engaged a consultancy ®rm to conduct market research on the feasibility of setting up cafeÂ s in Shanghai. We intend to establish our cafeÂ business in Shanghai in FY2002. The recent success of cafeÂ chains such as Starbucks in Shanghai re¯ect the increasing popularity of cafeÂ s in the city. We believe that our cafeÂ business has potential for growth and development in PRC. PRC has seen coffee consumption growth of between 15% and 20% in the last 3 years from 1998 to 2000 as compared with global consumption growth of between 1% and 2% over the same period1. 1 Source : Neumann Kaffee Gruppe Statistical Unit Quarterly Report (Quarter I-II 2001). 83 PROSPECTS, BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND FUTURE PLANS DIRECTORS Our Board of Directors is entrusted with the responsibility for the overall management of our Group.

ADVISER TO OUR BOARD Our Group's management is advised by Wong Sek Fook, one of the pioneers of our Group. Wong Sek Fook joined our Group in 1941 and has 59 years' working experience in the coffee and tea industry. He was a director and Chairman of our Group until 1999. On 22 May 2001, we entered into a new consultancy agreement with Great Joy International Development Limited (``Great Joy''), later supplemented by a supplemental agreement dated 11 July 2001 between the same parties (the ``New Consultancy Agreement'') for a fee of HK$0.7 million per annum, of which HK$0.4 million is to be paid on 1 January of each year as a retainer fee (``Retainer Fee'') and the balance to be paid monthly at the rate of HK$25,000 per month. Under the terms of the New Consultancy Agreement, Great Joy has an obligation to procure Wong Sek Fook to act as Adviser to our Board.

These represented 1.3% and 0.9% of our pro®t before taxation (before deducting such remuneration) for FY1999 and FY2000 respectively. Of the 269 employees in our Group as at 30 June 2001, only Wong Hoi Thung, Angela, our Executive Of®cer, is related to our Directors and substantial Shareholders. The remuneration of employees who are related to our Directors and substantial Shareholders will be reviewed annually by our Audit Committee to ensure that their remuneration packages are in line with our staff remuneration guidelines and commensurate with their respective job scope and level of responsibility. In the event that a member of our Audit Committee is related to the employee under review, he will abstain from the review. The aggregate remuneration paid to employees who are related to our Directors and substantial Shareholders and such Directors and substantial Shareholders will also be disclosed in our annual reports in the event that such remuneration exceeds 15% of our pro®t before taxation for that ®nancial year. SERVICE AGREEMENTS On 1 July 2001, our Company entered into separate service agreements (the ``Service Agreements'') with 4 of our Executive Directors, namely, Wong Tat Tong, Wong Tat Pui, Chan Chung Yee and Ching Kim Seung (the ``Appointees'') for a period of 3 years (unless otherwise terminated by either party giving not less than 3 months' notice to the other). 90 DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT AND STAFF Pursuant to the terms of the respective service agreements, Wong Tat Tong, Wong Tat Pui, Chan Chung Yee and Ching Kim Seung are entitled to a monthly salary of HK$234,300, HK$31,820 and A$3,000, HK$68,590 and HK$71,380 respectively. The Appointees are also entitled to an annual wage supplement of a month's salary. Wong Tat Tong is entitled to the use of a car provided by us and Wong Tat Tong and Wong Tat Pui are also entitled to furnished housing provided by us. Details of Wong Tat Tong's housing bene®ts are set under the heading ``Interested Person Transactions'' on page 97 of this Prospectus. In addition, the Appointees are each entitled to a performance bonus based on the Consolidated Pro®t Before Tax, which is de®ned as, in respect of a ®nancial year of our Company, the consolidated pro®t before tax and performance bonus of our Company and subsidiaries for that ®nancial year after deducting pro®t attributable to minority interests and excluding any exceptional items and extraordinary items. The performance bonus will be calculated on the basis of the consolidated audited accounts of our Group for the ®nancial year preceding the date of payment of the performance bonus. The entitlement of each of the Appointees to the performance bonus shall be calculated as follows:± Wong Tat Tong Wong Tat Tong shall be entitled to a performance bonus equal to 3.8% of the Consolidated Pro®t Before Tax. Wong Tat Pui Wong Tat Pui shall be entitled to a performance bonus equal 0.4% of the Consolidated Pro®t Before Tax. Chan Chung Yee Chan Chung Yee shall be entitled to a performance bonus equal 0.4% of the Consolidated Pro®t Before Tax. Ching Kim Seung Ching Kim Seung shall be entitled to a performance bonus equal to 0.4% of the Consolidated Pro®t Before Tax. In addition, the Appointees are entitled to other bene®ts, including insurance coverage, health and medical bene®ts. None of our Directors has any service agreements with our Company or any of our subsidiaries providing bene®ts upon termination of employment. Our Board of Directors will review the total remuneration package (including any increment) of each of the Appointees annually after our Audit Committee has reviewed and approved the total remuneration package (including any increment) of each of the Appointees annually. Our Executive Directors will abstain from voting in respect of any resolution on the review of their own salaries. Had the service agreements been in place throughout FY2000, the aggregate remuneration paid to our Executive Directors would have been approximately HK$8.5 million instead of HK$6.7 million and our pro®t before taxation and pro®t attributable to Shareholders for FY2000 would have been HK$35.2 million and HK$29.7 million respectively. 91 DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT AND STAFF On 29 November 2001, our Shareholders at a Special General Meeting had approved an employee share option scheme known as the ``Tsit Wing Employees' Share Option Scheme 2001'' (the ``Scheme''), the rules of which are set out in Annex C of this Prospectus. The Scheme will provide eligible participants with an opportunity to participate in the equity of our Company and to motivate them towards better performance through increased dedication and loyalty. The Scheme, which also forms an integral and important component of a compensation plan, is designed to primarily reward and retain executive Directors and employees whose services are vital to our well being and success. Terms de®ned in Annex C shall, unless otherwise de®ned herein, have the same meanings when used herein. Objectives of the Scheme The objectives of the Scheme are as follows:± (a) the motivation of participants to optimise standards and ef®ciency and to maintain a high level of contribution; (b) the retention of key Group Employees whose contributions are important to the long-term growth and prosperity of our Group; (c) the recruitment of key Group Employees whose contributions would be important to the long- term growth and prosperity of our Group; and (d) the development of a participatory style of management which instills loyalty and a stronger sense of identi®cation with the long-term prosperity of our Group. Summary of the Scheme A summary of the rules of the Scheme is set out as follows:± (1) Participants Under the rules of the Scheme, the following persons are eligible to participate in the Scheme:± (a) executive and non-executive directors and employees of our Group (``Group Employees''); (b) executive and non-executive directors and employees of any holding company of our Company or any subsidiary of such holding company other than our Group (``Parent Group Employees''); and (c) executive and non-executive directors and employees of any associated company of our Company over which our Company has control (``Associated Company Employees''). Persons who qualify under the categories above and who are also our Company's Controlling Shareholders or their associates may not participate in the Scheme. Presently, Wong Tat Tong and Wong Tat Pui are both Controlling Shareholders of our Company. They and their associates may not participate in the Scheme. Currently, we do not have any associated companies which we have control over and we do not intend to grant options to Parent Group Employees. (2) Scheme Administration The Scheme shall be administered by a committee (the ``Committee'') with powers to determine, inter alia, the following:± (a) persons to be granted options; (b) number of options to be offered; and (c) recommendations for modi®cations to the Scheme. 92 TSIT WING EMPLOYEES' SHARE OPTION SCHEME 2001 The Committee will consist of Directors and such other persons as may be nominated by the holding company for our Company (including Directors or persons who may be participants of the Scheme). A member of the Committee who is also a participant of the Scheme must not be involved in its deliberation in respect of options granted or to be granted to him. (3) Scheme Size The aggregate number of Shares over which the Committee may grant options on any date, when aggregated with the number of Shares issued and issuable in respect of all options granted under the Scheme, shall not exceed 15% of the issued Shares of our Company on the day preceding that date. (4) Maximum Entitlements The number of Shares comprised in any options to be offered to a participant in the Scheme shall be determined at the absolute discretion of the Committee, who shall take into account criteria such as rank, past performance, years of service and potential for future development of that participant, provided that the aggregate number of Shares which may be offered by way of grant of options to Parent Group Employees collectively under the Scheme shall not exceed 20% of the total number of Shares available under the Scheme, and such aggregate number of Shares which may be offered to Parent Group Employees collectively under the Scheme has been approved by independent shareholders of our Company in a separate resolution and any options to be granted to any Parent Group Employee which, together with options already granted to that Parent Group Employee under the Scheme, represents 5% or more of the aggregate number of Shares available to Parent Group Employees collectively, shall be approved by independent shareholders of our Company in a separate resolution for each such Parent Group Employee. (5) Options, Exercise Period and Exercise Price The options that are granted under the Scheme may have exercise prices that are, at the Committee's discretion, set at a discount to the market price of a Share (``Incentive Option''), in which event, such options may be exercised after the second anniversary of the date of grant of the option or ®xed at a price equal to the average of the last dealt prices for the shares on the SGX-ST for the 5 consecutive market days immediately preceding the relevant date of grant of the relevant option (``Market Price Option''), in which event, such options may be exercised after the ®rst anniversary of the date of grant of that option. Additionally, our Company will also have the discretion to impose conditions on exercise of the options such as limiting the number of Shares in respect of which the option may be exercised during the exercise period applicable to that option. Options granted under the Scheme to employees and executive directors of our Company and its related corporations will have a life span of 10 years. All other options granted under the Scheme will have a life span of 5 years. (6) Grant of Options Under the rules of the Scheme, there are no ®xed periods for the grant of options. As such, offers of the grant of options may be made at any time from time to time at the discretion of the Committee. However in the event that an announcement on any matter of an exceptional nature involving unpublished price sensitive information is imminent, offers may only be made after the second market day from the date on which the aforesaid announcement is made. (7) Termination of Options Special provisions in the rules of the Scheme deal with the lapse or earlier exercise of options in circumstances which include the termination of the participant's cessation of employment in our 93 TSIT WING EMPLOYEES' SHARE OPTION SCHEME 2001 Group, the bankruptcy of the participant, the death of the participant, a take-over of our Company and the winding-up of our Company. (8) Acceptance of Options The closing date for acceptance for the grant of options shall not be less than 15 days and not more than 30 days from the date of the offer. Offers of options made to grantees, if not accepted before the closing date, will lapse. Upon acceptance of the offer, the grantee must pay our Company a consideration of HK$1.00. (9) Rights of Shares Arising Shares arising from the exercise of options are subject to the provisions of the Memorandum of Association and Bye-Laws of our Company. The Shares so allotted will upon issue rank pari passu in all respects with the then existing issued Shares, save for any dividend, rights, allotments or distributions, the record date (``Record Date'') for which falls on or before the relevant exercise date of the option. ``Record Date'' means the date as at the close of business on which the shareholders must be registered in order to participate in any dividends rights, allotments or other distributions. (10) Duration of the Scheme The Scheme shall continue in operation for a maximum duration of 10 years and may be continued for any further period thereafter with the approval of our Company in general meeting and of any relevant authorities which may then be required. Grant of Options with a Discounted Exercise Price The ability to offer options to participants of the Scheme with exercise prices set at a discount to the prevailing market prices of the Shares will operate as a means to recognise participants for their performance as well as to motivate them to continue to excel while encouraging them to greater dedication and loyalty to our Group through longer vesting period before the option may be exercised. The flexibility to grant options with discounted prices is also intended to cater to situations where the stock market performance has overrun the general market conditions. In such events, the Committee will have absolute discretion to:± (i) grant options with discounted exercise prices subject to the aforesaid limit; and (ii) determine the participants to whom, and the options to which, such reduction in exercise prices will apply. In determining whether to give a discount and the quantum of the discount, the Committee shall be at liberty to take into consideration factors including the performance of our Company, our Group, the performance of the participant concerned, the contribution of the participant to the success and development of our Group and the prevailing market conditions. It is envisaged that our Company may consider granting the options with exercise prices set at a discount to the market price of the Shares prevailing at the time of grant under circumstances including (but not limited to) the following:± (a) where, due to speculative forces in the stock market resulting in an overrun of the market, the market price of the Shares at the time of the grant of options is not a true reflection of the financial performance of our Company; (b) to enable our Company to offer competitive remuneration packages in the event that the practice of granting options with exercise prices that have a discount element becomes a general market norm. As share options become more significant components of executive remuneration 94 TSIT WING EMPLOYEES' SHARE OPTION SCHEME 2001 packages, a discretion to grant options with discounted prices will provide our Company with a means to maintain the competitiveness of our Group's compensation strategy; and/or (c) where our Group needs to provide more compelling motivation for speci®c business units to improve their performance, grants of share options with discounted exercise prices will help to align the interests of employees to those of the shareholders as they would be perceived more positively by the employees who receive such options. The Committee will determine on a case-by-case basis whether a discount will be given, and if so, the quantum of the discount, taking into account the objective that is desired to be achieved by our Company and the prevailing market conditions. As the actual discount given will depend on the relevant circumstances, the extent of the discount may vary from one case to another, subject to a maximum discount of 20% of the market price of a Share, as described in paragraph (5) above. The discretion to grant options to subscribe for Shares at an exercise price set at a discount to the market price will, however, be used judiciously. The amount of the discount may vary from one offer to another, and from time to time, subject to a limit of 20% on the quantum of discount in respect of options granted under the Scheme. In determining the quantum of such discount, the Committee will take into consideration such criteria as the Committee may, in its absolute discretion, deem appropriate including but not limited to:± (i) the performance of our Company and our Group; (ii) the individual performance of the participant; and (iii) the contribution of the participant to the success and development of our Company and/or our Group. Such ¯exibility in determining the quantum of discount would enable the Committee to tailor the incentives in the grant of options to be commensurate with the performance and contribution of each individual participant. By individually recognising the degree of performance and contribution of each participant, the granting of options at a commensurate discount would enable the Committee to provide incentives for better performance, greater dedication and loyalty of the participants. Our Company may also grant options without any discount to the market price. Additionally, our Company may, if it deems ®t, impose conditions on the exercise of the options (whether such options are granted at the market price or at a discount to the market price), such as restricting the number of Shares for which the option may be exercised during the initial years following its vesting. For non-executive Directors, at this stage, no decision has yet been made by our Company on the terms of the grant of options and on whether options will be granted at a discount to the market price. However, should our Company decide in the future to grant options to them at a discount, such decision would be based on factors such as individual performance of the participant and the contribution of the participant to the success and development of our Company and/or our Group. Participants in the Scheme (a) Executive Directors and Employees of our Group The extension of the Scheme to Executive Directors and employees allows our Group to have a fair and equitable system to reward executive employees who have made and who continue to make important contributions to the long-term growth of our Group. The Scheme will also operate to attract, retain and provide incentives to its participants to achieve higher standards of performance as well as encourage greater dedication and loyalty by enabling our Company to give recognition to past contributions and services as well as motivating participants generally to contribute towards our Company's long-term prosperity. 95 TSIT WING EMPLOYEES' SHARE OPTION SCHEME 2001 (b) Participation of Non-Executive Directors The non-executive Directors of our Group are in a position to provide valuable support, input and business contacts and to contribute their experience, knowledge and expertise, and/or to provide our Company and our Group with strategic or signi®cant business alliances or opportunities. This category of persons comprises individuals from various disciplines with different working experience and backgrounds whom we may tap for assistance in furthering the business interest of our Company and/or our Group. Currently, remuneration is by way of Directors' fees to non-executive Directors (for their services as directors of a company), which is wholly in the form of cash. Although the level of their remuneration is in accordance with the level of remuneration paid to non-executive directors of other companies, by including for coverage in the Scheme, our Company will have the ¯exibility to consider, in the future, compensating non-executive Directors for their services in cash and in share options. Through the Scheme, our Company may acknowledge and give recognition to the efforts, achievements and contributions made by such persons in a combination of cash and share options. Cost of the Scheme to our Company Any options granted under the Scheme, whether such options are Market Price Options or Incentive Options, would have a fair value. In the event that such options are granted at prices below the fair value of the options, there will be a cost to our Company. The amounts of such costs may be more signi®cant in the case of Incentive Options, where such options are granted with exercise prices set at a discount to the prevailing market price of the Shares. The cost to our Company of granting options under the Scheme would be as follows:± (i) the exercise of an option at the exercise price would translate into a reduction of the proceeds from the exercise of such option, as compared to the proceeds that our Company would have received from such exercise had the exercise been made at the prevailing market price of the Shares. Such reduction of the exercise proceeds would represent the monetary cost to our Company; (ii) as the monetary cost of granting options with a discounted exercise price is borne by our Company, the earnings of our Company would effectively be reduced by an amount corresponding to the reduced interest earnings that our Company would have received from the difference in proceeds from an exercise price with no discount versus the discounted exercise price. Such reduction would, accordingly, result in the dilution of our Company's EPS; and (iii) the effect of the issue of new Shares upon the exercise of options on our Company's NTA per Share is accretive if the exercise price is above the NTA per Share, but dilutive otherwise. The costs as discussed above would only materialise upon the exercise of the relevant options. Currently, the Singapore Statements of Accounting Standard (``SAS'') do not require companies to account for share-based awards granted to their employees. Accordingly, companies have not recognised any compensation expenses relating to share options granted to their employees in their ®nancial statements. However, share options have value because the option to buy a company's share for a ®xed price during an extended future time period is a valuable right, even if there are restrictions attached to such an option. If the SAS is revised such that our Company is required to account for share-based awards granted to our employees, the cost of granting Options will affect our ®nancial results. 96 TSIT WING EMPLOYEES' SHARE OPTION SCHEME 2001 INTERESTED PERSON TRANSACTIONS Save as disclosed below, none of our Directors, Executive Of®cers or substantial Shareholders has any interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction undertaken by our Group which may be material for the last 3 ®nancial years ended 31 December 2000 and for the 6 months ended 30 June 2001. Transactions with Telenice Company Ltd (``Telenice'') Telenice is a company which Wong Tat Tong, our Executive Director, through Global King, may have an indirect interest of 99.99%. On 3 January 2001, we entered into a tenancy agreement with Telenice for a period of 12 months with effect from 1 January 2001. Pursuant to the tenancy agreement, we leased from Telenice the property known as Flat B, 11/F, Medallion Heights, 45 Conduit Road, Mid-Level, Hong Kong for a monthly rental of HK$53,000 a month or HK$26.50 per sq ft. The rental fee was based on the prevailing market rate. The property was intended for Wong Tat Tong's accommodation pursuant to the terms of his service agreement. Further lease renewal shall be at rental rates that are no higher than prevailing market rates for other properties in similar locations and of similar quality as veri®ed by an independent property valuer and will be subject to the review of the Audit Committee. Transactions with Great Joy International Development Ltd On 1 January 2000, we entered into a consultancy agreement with Great Joy for a fee of HK$1.6 million per annum. Great Joy is a company in which Wong Sek Fook and his immediate family have, directly or indirectly, an interest of 100%. Wong Sek Fook is the father of Wong Tat Tong, Wong Tat Pui and Wong Hoi Thung, Angela. The interest of Wong Sek Fook's immediate family (including Wong Tat Pui, our Director, and Wong Hoi Thung, Angela, our Executive Of®cer) arises by virtue of their being eligible bene®ciaries of The Wong Family 2000 Trust which has an indirect interest in Great Joy. On 22 May 2001, on the mutual agreement of the parties, the consultancy agreement with Great Joy dated 1 January 2000 was terminated and we entered into the New Consultancy Agreement, pursuant to which a fee of HK$0.7 million per annum is payable to Great Joy, of which HK$0.4 million is to be paid on 1 January of each year as Retainer Fee and the balance to be paid monthly at the rate of HK$25,000 per month. Pursuant to the terms of the New Consultancy Agreement, Great Joy has an obligation to procure Wong Sek Fook to act as Adviser to the Board. The New Consultancy Agreement is subject to early termination by us if Wong Sek Fook is unwilling or unable to continue to act as adviser to our Board. Great Joy may also terminate the consultancy agreement by giving one month's notice to us. In such event, the portion of the Retainer Fee for the remaining months of the year after which Wong Sek Fook discontinues to act as Adviser to our Board will be refunded by Great Joy. The Audit Committee has reviewed the New Consultancy Agreement and is of the opinion that the terms of the agreement are based on normal commercial terms and not prejudicial to the interest of our Company and our Group. In future, any interested persons transactions (``IPT'') will be documented and submitted semi-annually to the Audit Committee for their review so as to ensure that such transactions are carried out at arm's length and on normal commercial terms. In addition, we are subject to the mandatory provisions in prevailing legislation and the rules prescribed in the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST. In the event that a member of the Audit Committee is deemed to have an interest in an IPT, he will abstain from reviewing that particular transaction. The Audit Committee will review the IPT as part of the standard procedures during the Audit Committee's examination of the adequacy of our Group's internal controls. None of our Directors, Executive Of®cers and substantial Shareholders has any interest in any company outside our Group carrying out the same business or dealings in similar products. 97 INTEREST OF MANAGEMENT AND OTHERS IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Our Directors understand the importance of corporate governance and the need for high standards of accountability to the shareholders of our Company. The Audit Committee shall meet periodically to perform the following functions:± (i) review the audit plans of our Company's external auditors; (ii) review the external auditors' reports; (iii) review the financial statements of our Company and our Group before their submission to our Board of Directors; (iv) nominate the external auditors for re-appointment; and (v) review interested persons transactions, if any.

Subsequently, Wong Tat Pui and Tsim Man Lam transferred their aggregate equity interest of 200 ordinary shares of A$1.00 each in TW Australia to TW International for a consideration of A$200.

TW Zhuhai is entitled to tax exemption for the ®rst two years of pro®table operations and tax reduction of 50% in the next three years of operations.

However, the PRC tax authority is revisiting the tax position of TW Zhuhai and is of the opinion that certain expenses of TW Zhuhai are not tax deductible. No assessment has been issued by the PRC tax authority as at the date of this report. The directors estimated that the aggregate sum of income tax payable for the period of its date of establishment to 31 December 2000 would be insigni®cant.

G PROFORMA STATEMENT OF NET ASSETS The Proforma Statement of Net Assets of the Group and the Company as at 30 June 2001 is set out as follows:± Notes Group HK$'000 Company HK$'000 ASSETS Current assets: Cash 27,692 Ð Trade receivables 2 33,260 Ð Other receivables and prepayments 3 15,583 2,122 Inventories 4 33,774 Ð Total current assets 110,309 2,122 Non-current assets: Subsidiaries 5 Ð 78,563 Property, plant and equipment 6 24,149 Ð Total non-current assets 24,149 78,563 Total assets 134,458 80,685 111 ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT F STATEMENT OF ADJUSTMENTS (cont'd) Notes Group HK$'000 Company HK$'000 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Current liabilities: Trust receipt loan and overdrafts 7 5,700 Ð Trade payables 13,532 Ð Other payables 8 8,101 2,122 Income tax payable 4,071 Ð Dividend payable 12,845 Ð Total current liabilities 44,249 2,122 Minority interests 11,646 Ð Shareholders' equity 9 78,563 78,563 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity 134,458 80,685 H SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies which have been adopted in arriving at the ®nancial information set out in this report and which conform with Singapore Statements of Accounting Standard (``SAS'') are as follows:± Basis of accounting The Proforma Statement of Group Results, Proforma Statement of Group Balance Sheets, Proforma Statement of Recognised Gains and Losses and Proforma Statement of Net Assets expressed in Hong Kong dollars are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention and have been properly drawn up in accordance with the Singapore Statements of Accounting Standard. Basis of consolidation The Proforma Statement of Group Results, Proforma Statement of Group Balance Sheets, the Proforma Statement of Recognised Gains and Losses and Proforma Statement of Net Assets incorporate the ®nancial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to the respective year ends from 1998 to 2000 and six months to 30 June 2001 and have been prepared on the assumption that the current group structure had been in existence throughout the period under review or since the respective dates of incorporation of the companies in the Proforma Group whichever is earlier. All signi®cant intercompany transactions and balances within the Proforma Group are eliminated on consolidation. Minority interests represent their share in the net pro®ts and net assets of the respective subsidiaries. Goodwill or capital reserve arising on consolidation represents the difference between the cost of the Company's investment over the Company's share of the fair value of the net identi®able assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries acquired. Prior to 1 January 2001, goodwill arising from acquisition of subsidiaries and associates are directly adjusted against shareholders' equity. With effect from 1 January 2001, the Proforma Group has adopted SAS 22 Ð Business Combination to amortise goodwill over varying periods of a maximum period of twenty years. Goodwill on 112 ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT G PROFORMA STATEMENT OF NET ASSETS (cont'd) acquisition arising prior to 1 January 2001 has been charged in full to the accumulated pro®ts; such goodwill has not been retrospectively capitalised and amortised, as allowed under revised SAS 22 Ð Business Combination. The gain or loss on disposal of an entity includes the unamortised balance of goodwill relating to the entity disposed of, or for pre-1 January 2001 acquisitions, the goodwill charged to shareholders' equity. Translation of foreign currency ®nancial statements The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that are not considered integral to the operations of the Company are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. The results of foreign subsidiaries that are not considered integral to the operations of the Company are translated at average rates during the year. Foreign currency translation adjustments are reported separately and accumulated in a separate component of equity in the Proforma Statement of Group Balance Sheets. Inventories Inventories comprising raw materials, work-in-progress and ®nished goods are measured at the lower of cost (weighted average method) and net realisable value. Cost includes all costs of purchase, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Subsidiaries Investment in subsidiaries is stated at cost in the Company's ®nancial statements. Provision is made for any permanent diminution in value. Depreciation Depreciation is provided on gross carrying amounts in equal annual instalment, over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The annual rates of depreciation are as follows:± Leasehold land Over the unexpired term of the lease Buildings 4% Plant and machinery 81/3% to 20% Furniture, ®xtures and equipment 20% Computer equipment 20% Motor vehicles 20% Depreciation is not provided on freehold land. In the previous years, depreciation was provided to write off the cost of plant and machinery over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, at 331/3% per annum. During the ®nancial years ended 31 December 1998 and 31 December 1999, the directors re-assessed the appropriateness of the depreciation policy on plant and machinery and increased the depreciation period of plant and machinery from 3 years to 7 years. In the opinion of the directors, they considered the extension of the estimated useful lives of plant and machinery re¯ects more fairly the present condition and usage of the plant and machinery. Accordingly, the carrying value of plant and machinery is depreciated on a prospective basis over the remaining estimated useful lives on a straight line basis. The effect of this change in the assessment of the estimated useful lives of plant and machinery does not have a material impact on the Proforma Statement of Group Results. Fully depreciated assets still in use are retained in the Proforma Statement of Group Balance Sheets. 113 ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT H SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont'd) Finance leases A ®nance lease is recognised as an asset and as a liability in the balance sheet at amounts equal at the inception of the lease to the fair value of the leased asset or if lower, at the present value of the lease payments based on the interest rate implicit in the lease. The excess of the lease payments over the recorded lease obligations are treated as ®nance charges which are allocated to each lease term so as to produce a constant rate of charge on the remaining balance of the obligations. The assets are depreciated as owned depreciable assets. Revenue recognition Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when signi®cant risk and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer and the amount of revenue and the costs of the transaction (including future costs) can be measured reliably. Income tax Tax expense is determined on the basis of tax effect accounting, using the liability method, and it is applied to all signi®cant differences except that a debit balance or a debit to the deferred tax balance is not carried forward. Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in Hong Kong dollars at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, recorded monetary balances that are denominated in foreign currencies are reported at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. All realised and unrealised exchange adjustment gains and losses are dealt with in the Proforma Statement of Group Results. Staff provident fund contributions The amount of contributions payable to the Proforma Group's de®ned contribution scheme and the Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme (``MPF Scheme'') (Note 14) is charged to the Proforma Statement of Group Results as they fall due. Financial assets Financial assets include cash and bank balances, trade and other receivables. Trade and other receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classi®ed according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. Financial liabilities include trade and other payables, bank loans and overdrafts. Trade and other payables are stated at their nominal value. Bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Finance costs are accounted for on an accrual basis (effective yield method) and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in shareholders' equity in the period in which they are declared. 114 ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT H SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont'd) I NOTES TO THE PROFORMA STATEMENT OF NET ASSETS AS AT 30 JUNE 2001 1.

Retirement Bene®ts Scheme Prior to 1 December 2000, the Proforma Group operated a de®ned contribution retirement bene®ts scheme (``De®ned Contribution Scheme'') for its qualifying employees in Hong Kong. The assets of the scheme were held separately from those of the Proforma Group in funds under the control of an independent trustee. Where there are employees who leave the De®ned Contribution Scheme prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the amount of the forfeited contributions would be used to reduce future contributions payable by the Proforma Group. The De®ned Contribution Scheme would continue until all the existing scheme members leave the scheme. No new member would be accepted after 30 November 2000. Effective 1 December 2000, the Proforma Group has joined the MPF Scheme for all of its eligible employees in Hong Kong. The MPF scheme is registered with the Mandatory Provident Fund Scheme Authority under the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Ordinance in Hong Kong. The assets of the MPF scheme are held separately from those of the Proforma Group in funds under the control of an independent trustee. Under the rule of the MPF Scheme, the employer and its employees are each required to make contributions to the scheme at rate speci®ed in the rules. The only obligation of the Proforma Group with respect to the MPF Scheme is to make the required contributions under the scheme. No forfeited contribution is available to reduce the contribution payable in the future years. The retirement bene®t scheme contributions arising from the De®ned Contribution Scheme and the MPF Scheme charged to the pro®t and loss statement represent contributions payable to the funds by the Proforma Group at rates speci®ed in the rules of the schemes. 120 ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT I NOTES TO THE PROFORMA STATEMENT OF NET ASSETS AS AT 30 JUNE 2001 (cont'd) 15. Financial instruments (a) Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a loss to the Proforma Group. The Proforma Group has adopted the policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparts and obtaining suf®cient collateral or other security where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of ®nancial losses from defaults. The Proforma Group measures credit risk on a fair value basis. The Proforma Group does not have any signi®cant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics. The carrying amount of ®nancial assets recorded in the ®nancial statements, net of any provision for losses, represents the Proforma Group's maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral or other security obtained. (b) Signi®cant concentrations of credit risk Concentrations of credit risk exist when changes in economic, industry or geographical factors similarly affect group of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is signi®cant in relation to the Proforma Group's total credit exposure. Although the Proforma Group's credit exposure is concentrated mainly in Hong Kong and the People's Republic of China, the Proforma Group's policy does not permit non-secured credit risks to be signi®cantly centralised in one customer or group of customers. (c) Interest rate risk The interest rates and terms of repayment of the trust receipt loans and overdrafts of the Proforma Group are disclosed in Note 7. (d) Currency risk The Proforma Group's foreign currency exposures arose mainly from the exchange rate movements of the United States dollar, the Renminbi and the Hong Kong dollar, which is also the Proforma Group's reporting currency. To the extent that the Proforma Group's sales and purchases are not matched in the same currency, the Proforma Group could be exposed to currency ¯uctuation of the United States dollar and Renminbi against Hong Kong dollar. To hedge against the volatility of future cash ¯ows caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Proforma Group may, when necessary, utilise forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the Proforma Group's exposure to speci®c currency risks relating to purchases of raw materials and other foreign currency ¯uctuations. (e) Net fair value The carrying amount of ®nancial assets and ®nancial liabilities recorded in the ®nancial statements represents their respective net fair values, determined in accordance with the accounting policies disclosed in Section H. 121 ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT I NOTES TO THE PROFORMA STATEMENT OF NET ASSETS AS AT 30 JUNE 2001 (cont'd) 16.

The Memorandum of Association also sets out the objects for which our Company was formed, including acting as a holding and investment company, and its powers, including the powers set out in the First Schedule to the Bermuda Act. As an exempted company, our Company will be carrying on business outside Bermuda from a place of business within Bermuda. In accordance with and subject to Section 42A of the Bermuda Act, the Memorandum of Association of our Company empowers it to purchase its own shares and pursuant to its Bye- Laws, this power is exercisable by the Board of Directors upon such terms and subject to such conditions as it thinks ®t. 2. SELECTED BYE-LAWS Directors' fees and expenses Bye-Law 98 Fees payable to non-executive Directors shall be a ®xed sum (not being a commission on or a percentage of pro®ts or turnover of the Company) as shall from time to time be determined by the Company in general meeting, such sum (unless otherwise directed by such resolution) shall be divided amongst the Directors in such proportions and in such manner as the Board may agree, or failing agreement, equally, except that in such event any Director holding of®ce for less than the whole of the relevant period in respect of which the remuneration is paid shall only rank in such division in proportion to the time during such period for which he has held of®ce. The foregoing provisions shall not apply to a Director who holds any salaried employment or of®ce in the Company except in the case of sums paid in respect of Directors' fees. Salaries payable to executive Directors may not include a commission or a percentage of turnover of the Company. Fees payable to Directors shall not be increased except at a general meeting convened by a notice specifying the intention to propose such increase. Bye-Law 99 The Directors shall also be entitled to be repaid all travelling, hotel and other expenses reasonably incurred by them respectively in or about the performance of their duties as Directors, including their expenses of travelling to and from board meetings, committee meetings or general meetings or otherwise incurred whilst engaged in the business of the Company or in the discharge of their duties as Directors. Bye-Law 100 The Board may grant special remuneration to any Director who, being called upon, shall perform any special or extra services to or at the request of the Company. Such special remuneration may be made payable to such Director in addition to or in substitution for his ordinary remuneration as a Director, as the Board may determine. A-1 ANNEX A Bye-Law 101 (A) Notwithstanding Bye-Laws 98, 99 and 100, the remuneration of a Managing Director, Joint Managing Director, Deputy Managing Director or an Executive Director or a Director appointed to any other of®ce in the management of the Company may from time to time be ®xed by the Board and with such other bene®ts (including pension and/or gratuity and/ or other bene®ts on retirement) and allowances as the Board may from time to time decide, but he shall not in any circumstance be renumerated by a commission on or a percentage of turnover. Such remuneration shall be in addition to his ordinary remuneration as a Directo(r) (B) Payments to any Director or past Director of any sum by way of compensation for loss of of®ce or as consideration for or in connection with his retirement from of®ce (not being a payment to which the Director is contractually entitled) must be approved by the Company in general meeting. Alternate directors Bye-Law 95(B) A Director may at any time, by notice in writing signed by him delivered to the Registered Of®ce or to the Head Of®ce or at a meeting of the Board, appoint any person approved by the majority of the other Directors to act as alternate Director in his place during his absence and may in like manner at any time determine such appointment, Provided That any fee paid by the Company to the alternate shall be deducted from that Director's remuneration. Such appointment unless previously approved by the Board shall have effect only upon and subject to being so approved. The appointment of an alternate Director shall determine on the happening of any event which, were he a Director, would cause him to vacate such of®ce or if his appointor ceases to be a Director. Bye-Law 96(A) Any alternate Director may be removed by the Company in general meeting by Ordinary Resolution and, if appointed by the Board, may be removed by the Board and, subject thereto, the of®ce of alternate Director shall continue until the next annual election of Directors in accordance with Bye-Law 104 or, if earlier, the date on which the relevant Director ceases to be a Director. No Director may act as an alternate Director. A person may not act as an alternate Director for more than one (1) Director at the same time, save and except for any alternate Director resident in Bermuda who may act as alternate to more than one (1) Director resident in Bermuda. Bye-Law 96(B) An alternate Director shall be entitled to contract and be interested in and bene®t from contracts or arrangements or transactions and to be repaid expenses and to be indemni®ed to the same extent mutatis mutandis as if he were a Director, but he shall not be entitled to receive from the Company in respect of his appointment as alternate Director any remuneration except only such part (if any) of the ordinary remuneration otherwise payable to his appointor as such appointor may by notice in writing to the Company from time to time direct. A-2 ANNEX A Bye-Law 96(C) An alternate Director shall, if his appointor so requests, be entitled to receive notices of meetings of the Board or committees of the Board to the same extent as, but in lieu of, the Director appointing him and shall be entitled to such extent to attend and vote as a Director at any such meeting at which the Director appointing him is not personally present and generally at such meeting to exercise and discharge all the functions, powers and duties of his appointor as a Director and for the purposes of the proceedings at such meeting the provisions of these Bye- Laws shall apply as if he were a Director. Bye-Law 96(D) Every person acting as an alternate Director shall (except as regards power to appoint an alternate Director and remuneration) be subject in all respects to the provisions of these Bye- Laws relating to Directors and shall alone be responsible to the Company for his acts and defaults and shall not be deemed to be the agent of or for the Director appointing him. Bye-Law 96(E) Every person acting as an alternate Director shall have one (1) vote for each Director for whom he acts as alternate (in addition to his own vote if he is also a Director). The signature of an alternate Director to any resolution in writing of the Board or a committee of the Board shall, unless the notice of his appointment provides to the contrary, be as effective as the signature of his appointor. Bye-Law 96(F) No alternate Director shall by virtue of that position be a director for the purposes of the Bermuda Act, but shall nevertheless be subject to the provisions of the Bermuda Act in so far as they relate to the duties and obligations of directors (other than the obligations to hold any qualifying share in the Company) when performing the functions of a Director. Directors' interest Bye-Law 103 (A) Subject to the Bermuda Act, a Director may hold any other of of®ce or place of pro®t with the Company (except that of Auditors) in conjunction with his of®ce of Director for such period and upon such terms as the Board may determine, and may be paid such extra remuneration therefor (whether by way of salary, commission, participation in pro®ts or otherwise) as the Board may determine, and such extra remuneration shall be in addition to any remuneration provided for, by or pursuant to any other Bye-Law. (B) Subject to the provisions of the Bermuda Act, a Director may notwithstanding his of®ce be a party to, or otherwise interested in, any transaction or arrangement with the Company or in which the Company is otherwise interested; and be a Director or other of®cer of, or employed by, or a party to any transaction or arrangement with, or otherwise interested in any body corporate promoted by the Company or in which the Company is interested. The Board may also cause the voting power conferred by the shares in any other company held or owned by the Company to be exercised in such manner in all respects as it thinks ®t, including the exercise thereof in favour of any resolution appointing the Directors or any of them to be directors or of®cers of such other company, or voting or providing for the payment of remuneration to the directors or of®cers of such other company. A-3 ANNEX A (C) So long as, where it is necessary, he declares the nature of his interest at the ®rst opportunity at a meeting of the Board or by writing to the Directors as required by the Bermuda Act, a Director shall not by reason of his of®ce be accountable to the Company for any bene®t which he derives from any of®ce or employment to which these Bye-Laws allow him to be appointed or from any transaction or arrangement in which these Bye-Laws allow him to be interested, and no such transaction or arrangement shall be liable to be avoided on the ground of any interest or bene®t. (D) Subject to the Bermuda Act and any further disclosure required thereby, a general notice to the Directors by a Director or of®cer declaring that he is a director or of®cer or has an interest in a person and is to be regarded as interested in any transaction or arrangement made with that person, shall be a suf®cient declaration of interest in relation to any transaction or arrangement so made. A Director shall not vote in respect of any contract proposed contract or arrangement in which he has directly or indirectly a personal material interest, and he may not be counted in the quorum present at the meeting. Borrowing powers of the Directors Bye-Law 110 The Board may from time to time at its discretion exercise all the powers of the Company to raise or borrow or to secure the payment of any sum or sums of money for the purposes of the Company and to mortgage or charge its undertaking, property and uncalled capital or any part thereof. Voting rights of the members of the Company Bye-Law 73 At any general meeting a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands unless a poll is (before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll) demanded:± (i) by the Chairman of the meeting; or (ii) by at least three (3) shareholders present in person or by a duly authorised corporate representative or by proxy for the time being entitled to vote at the meeting; or (iii) by any shareholder or shareholders present in person or by a duly authorised corporate representative or by proxy and representing not less than one-tenth (1/10) of the total voting rights of all the shareholders having the right to vote at the meeting; or (iv) by any shareholder or shareholders present in person or by a duly authorised corporate representative or by proxy and holding shares in the Company conferring a right to vote at the meeting being shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than one-tenth (1/10) of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring that right. Unless a poll be so demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the Chairman that a resolution has on a show of hands been carried or carried unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost, and an entry to that effect in the book containing the minutes of the proceedings of the Company shall be conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour or against such resolution. A-4 ANNEX A Bye-Law 74 If a poll is demanded as aforesaid, it shall (subject as provided in Bye-Law 76) be taken in such manner (including the use of ballot or voting papers or tickets) and at such time and place, not being more than thirty (30) days from the date of the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the poll was demanded, as the Chairman directs. No notice need be given of a poll not taken immediately. The result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. The demand for a poll may be withdrawn, with the consent of the Chairman, at any time before the close of the meeting at which the poll was demanded or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier. Bye-Law 75 Any poll duly demanded on the election of a Chairman of a meeting or on any question of adjournment shall be taken at the meeting and without adjournment. Bye-Law 76 In the case of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the Chairman of the meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded, shall be entitled to a second or casting vote. In case of any dispute as to the admission or rejection of any vote the Chairman shall determine the same, and such determination shall be ®nal and conclusive. Bye-Law 77 The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which a poll has been demanded. Bye-Law 78 For the purposes of section 106 of the Bermuda Act, a Special Resolution of the Company, and of any relevant class of shareholders, shall be required to approve any amalgamation agreement as referred to in that section. Bye-Law 79 Subject to any special rights, privileges or restrictions as to voting for the time being attached to any class or classes of shares, at any general meeting on a show of hands every shareholder who is present in person or by a duly authorised corporate representative or by proxy shall have one (1) vote, and on a poll every shareholder present in person or by a duly authorised corporate representative or by proxy, shall have one (1) vote for every share of which he is the holder which is fully paid up or credited as fully paid up (but so that no amount paid up or credited as paid up on a share in advance of calls or instalments shall be treated for the purposes of this Bye-Law as paid up on the share). On a poll a shareholder entitled to more than one (1) vote need not use all his votes or cast his votes in the same way. Bye-Law 80 Any person entitled under Bye-Law 49 to be registered as the holder of any shares may vote at any general meeting in respect thereof in the same manner as if he were the registered holder of such shares, provided that at least forty-eight (48) hours before the time of the holding of the meeting or adjourned meeting (as the case may be) at which he proposes to vote, he shall satisfy the Board of his right to be registered as the holder of such shares or the Board shall have previously admitted his right to vote at such meeting in respect thereof. A-5 ANNEX A Bye-Law 81 Where there are joint registered holders of any share, any one (1) of such persons may vote at any meeting, either personally or by proxy, in respect of such share as if he were solely entitled thereto; but if more than one (1) of such joint holders be present at any meeting personally or by proxy, that one (1) of the said persons so present whose name stands ®rst on the register in respect of such share shall alone be entitled to vote in respect thereof. Several executors or administrators of a deceased shareholder in whose name any share stands shall for the purposes of this Bye-Law be deemed joint holders thereof. Bye-Law 82 A shareholder of unsound mind or in respect of whom an order has been made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his committee, receiver, curator bonis or other person in the nature of a committee, receiver or curator bonis appointed by that court, and any such committee, receiver, curator bonis or other person may on a poll vote by proxy. Evidence to the satisfaction of the Board of the authority of the person claiming to exercise the right to vote shall be delivered to such place or one of such places (if any) as is speci®ed in accordance with these Bye-Laws for the deposit of instruments of proxy or, if no place is speci®ed, at the Registration Of®ce. Bye-Law 83 (A) Save as expressly provided in these Bye-Laws, no person other than a shareholder duly registered and who shall have paid everything for the time being due from him payable to the Company in respect of his shares shall be entitled to be present or to vote (save as proxy for another shareholder) either personally or by proxy or to be reckoned in a quorum (save as proxy for another shareholder), at any general meeting. (B) No objection shall be raised to the quali®cation of any voter except at the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the vote objected to is given or tendered, and every vote not disallowed at such meeting shall be valid for all purposes. Any such objection made in due time shall be referred to the Chairman, whose decision shall be ®nal and conclusive. Proxies Bye-Law 84 Any shareholder of the Company entitled to attend and vote at a meeting of the Company or a meeting of the holders of any class of shares in the Company shall be entitled to appoint another person as his proxy to attend and vote instead of him. Votes may be given either personally or by a duly authorised corporate representative or by proxy. A shareholder who is the holder of two (2) or more shares may appoint not more than two (2) proxies to attend on the same occasion. A proxy need not be a shareholder. In addition, a proxy or proxies representing either an individual shareholder or a shareholder which is a corporation, shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the shareholder which he or they represent as such shareholder could exercise including the right to vote individually on a show of hands. Bye-Law 85 Provided that if the shareholder is the Depository:± (A) notwithstanding Bye-Law 84, the Depository may appoint more than two (2) proxies to attend and vote at the same general meeting and each proxy shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the Depository as the Depository could exercise, including, notwithstanding Bye-Law 79, the right to vote individually on a show of hands; A-6 ANNEX A (B) the Company shall be entitled and bound:± (i) to reject any instrument of proxy lodged if the proxy first named in that instrument, being the Depositor, is not shown, in the records of the Depository as at a time not earlier than forty-eight (48) hours prior to the time of the relevant general meeting supplied by the Depository to the Company, to have any shares credited to a securities account; (ii) to accept as the maximum number of votes which in aggregate all the proxies appointed by the Depository in respect of a particular Depositor are able to cast on a poll a number which is the number of shares credited to the securities account of that Depositor, as shown in the records of the Depository as at a time not earlier than forty-eight (48) hours prior to the time of the relevant general meeting supplied by the Depository to the Company, whether that number is greater or smaller than the number specified in any instrument of proxy executed by or on behalf of the Depository; and (iii) the Company shall accept as valid in all respects the form of proxy approved by the Depository (the ``CDP Proxy Form'') for use at the date relevant to the general meeting in question notwithstanding that the same permits the Depositor concerned to nominate a person or persons other than himself as the proxy or proxies appointed by the Depository. The Company shall be entitled and bound, in determining rights to vote and other matters in respect of a completed CDP Proxy Form submitted to it, to have regard to the instructions given by and the notes (if any) set out in the CDP Proxy Form. Bye-Law 87 The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in writing under the hand of the appointor or of his attorney duly authorised in writing, or if the appointor is a corporation, either under seal or under the hand of an of®cer or attorney duly authorised or, in the case of the Depository, signed by its duly authorised of®cer by some method or system of mechanical signature as the Depository may deem appropriate. Bye-Law 88 The instrument appointing a proxy and the power of attorney or other authority, if any, under which it is signed on behalf of the appointor (which shall, for this purpose, include a Depositor) or a notarially certi®ed copy of that power or authority shall be deposited at such place or one (1) of such places (if any) as is speci®ed in the notice of meeting or in the instrument of proxy issued by the Company (or, if no place is speci®ed, at the Registration Of®ce) not less than forty-eight (48) hours before the time for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting or poll (as the case may be) at which the person named in such instrument proposes to vote, and in default the instrument of proxy shall not be treated as valid or, in the case of a poll taken subsequently to the date of a meeting or adjourned meeting not less than twenty four (24) hours before the time appointed for the taking of the poll and in default of the instrument of proxy shall not be treated as valid. No instrument appointing a proxy shall be valid after the expiration of twelve (12) months from the date of its execution, except at an adjourned meeting or on a poll demanded at a meeting or an adjourned meeting in a case where the meeting was originally held within twelve (12) months from such date. Delivery of an instrument appointing a proxy shall not preclude a shareholder from attending and voting in person at the meeting or upon the poll concerned and, in such event, the instrument appointing a proxy shall be deemed to be revoked. A-7 ANNEX A Bye-Law 89 Every instrument of proxy, whether for a speci®ed meeting or otherwise, shall be in any usual or common forms (including any form approved from time to time by the Depository) or in such other form as the Board may from time to time approve. Bye-Law 90 The instrument appointing a proxy to vote at a general meeting shall: (i) be deemed to confer authority upon the proxy to demand or join in demanding a poll and to vote on any resolution (or amendment thereto) put to the meeting for which it is given as the proxy thinks ®t. Provided that any form issued to a shareholder for use by him for appointing a proxy to attend and vote at a special general meeting or at an annual general meeting at which any business is to be transacted shall be such as to enable the shareholder, according to his intentions, to instruct the proxy to vote in favour of or against (or, in default of instructions, to exercise his discretion in respect of) each resolution dealing with any such business; and (ii) unless the contrary is stated therein, be valid as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to which it relates. Bye-Law 91 A vote given in accordance with the terms of an instrument of proxy or power of attorney or by the duly authorised corporate representative of a corporation shall be valid notwithstanding the previous death or insanity of the principal or revocation of the proxy or power of attorney or other authority under which the proxy was executed or the transfer of the share in respect of which the proxy is given, provided that no intimation in writing of such death, insanity, revocation or transfer as aforesaid shall have been received by the Company at its Registration Of®ce, or at such other place as is referred to in Bye-Law 88, at least two (2) hours before the commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the proxy is used. Bye-Law 92 In any case where a form of proxy appoints more than one (1) proxy (including the case where such appointment results from a nomination by the Depository), the proportion of the shareholding concerned to be represented by each proxy shall be speci®ed in the form of proxy. Corporations acting by representatives Bye-Law 86 (A) Any corporation which is a shareholder may by resolution of its directors or other governing body authorise such person as it thinks fit to act as its corporate representative at any meeting of the Company or any class of shareholders. The person so authorised shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of such corporation which he represents as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual shareholder. References in these Bye- Laws to a shareholder present in person at a meeting shall, unless the context otherwise requires, include a corporation which is a shareholder represented at the meeting by such duly authorised corporate representative or by one (1) or more proxies. Nothing contained in this Bye-Law shall prevent a corporation which is a shareholder of the Company from appointing one or more proxies to represent it subject to Bye-Law 84. A-8 ANNEX A (B) To the extent permitted by the Bermuda Act, where a shareholder is the Depository (or its nominee, in each case, being a corporation), it may authorise such person or persons as it thinks ®t to act as its corporate representative or representatives at any meeting of the Company or at any meeting of any class of shareholder provided that the authorisation shall specify the number and class of shares in respect of which each such representative is so authorised. Each person so authorised under the provisions of this Bye-Law shall be entitled to exercise the same rights and powers as if such person was the registered holder of the shares of the Company held by the Depository (or its nominee). (C) Any reference in these Bye-Laws to a duly authorised corporate representative of a shareholder being a corporation shall mean a corporate representative authorised under the provisions of this Bye-Law. Written resolutions of shareholders Bye-Law 63(B) Save where a general meeting is required by the Bermuda Act, a resolution in writing signed (in such manner as to indicate, expressly or impliedly, unconditional approval) by or on behalf of all persons for the time being entitled to receive notice of and to attend and vote at general meetings of the Company shall, for the purposes of these Bye-Laws, be treated as an Ordinary Resolution duly passed at a general meeting of the Company and, where relevant, as a Special Resolution so passed. Any such resolution shall be deemed to have been passed at a meeting held on the date on which it was signed by the last shareholder to sign, and where the resolution states a date as being the date of his signature thereof by any shareholder the statement shall be prima facie evidence that it was signed by him on that date. Such a resolution may consist of several documents in the like form, each signed by one (1) or more relevant shareholders. General meetings Bye-Law 63 (A) The Company shall in each year hold a general meeting as its annual general meeting in addition to any other meeting in that year and shall specify the meeting as such in the notice calling it; and not more than ®fteen (15) months shall elapse between the date of one annual general meeting of the Company and that of the next. The annual general meeting shall be held in the Relevant Territory or elsewhere as may be determined by the Board and at such time and place as the Board shall appoint. A meeting of the shareholders or any class thereof may be held by means of such telephone, electronic or other communication facilities as permit all persons participating in the meeting to communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting. (B) Save where a general meeting is required by the Bermuda Act, a resolution in writing signed (in such manner as to indicate, expressly or impliedly, unconditional approval) by or on behalf of all persons for the time being entitled to receive notice of and to attend and vote at general meetings of the Company shall, for the purposes of these Bye-Laws, be treated as an Ordinary Resolution duly passed at a general meeting of the Company and, where relevant, as a Special Resolution so passed. Any such resolution shall be deemed to have been passed at a meeting held on the date on which it was signed by the last shareholder to sign, and where the resolution states a date as being the date of his signature thereof by any shareholder the statement shall be prima facie evidence that it was signed by him on that date. Such a resolution may consist of several documents in the like form, each signed by one (1) or more relevant shareholders. A-9 ANNEX A Bye-Law 64 All general meetings other than annual general meetings shall be called special general meetings. Bye-Law 65 The Board may, whenever it thinks ®t, convene a special general meeting, and special general meetings shall also be convened on requisition, as provided by the Bermuda Act, and, in default, may be convened by the requisitionists as provided by the Act. Bye-Law 66 An annual general meeting and a meeting called for the passing of a Special Resolution shall be called by at least twenty-one (21) clear days' notice in writing, and a meeting of the Company other than an annual general meeting or a meeting for the passing of a Special Resolution shall be called by at least fourteen (14) clear days' notice in writing, to be given by advertisement in the Newspapers and in writing to the Designated Stock Exchange. The notice shall be given in clear days, and shall specify the place, the day and the hour of meeting and, in case of special business, must be accompanied by a statement regarding the general nature of that business and the effect of any proposed resolution in respect of such special business, the general nature of that business, and shall be given, in the manner hereinafter mentioned or in such other manner, if any, as may be prescribed by the Company in general meeting, to such persons as are, under these Bye-Laws, entitled to receive such notices from the Company, provided that, subject to the provisions of the Bermuda Act, a meeting of the Company shall notwithstanding that it is called by shorter notice than that specified in this Bye-Law be deemed to have been duly called if it is so agreed:± (i) in the case of a meeting called as the annual general meeting, by all the shareholders entitled to attend and vote thereat; and (ii) in the case of any other meeting, by a majority in number of the shareholders having a right to attend and vote at the meeting, being a majority together holding not less than ninety- ®ve per cent. (95%) in nominal value of the shares giving that right. Bye-Law 67 (A) The accidental omission to give any notice to, or the non-receipt of any notice by, any person entitled to receive notice shall not invalidate any resolution passed or any proceedings at any such meeting. (B) In the case where instruments of proxy are sent out with any notice, the accidental omission to send such instrument of proxy to, or the non-receipt of such instrument of proxy by, any person entitled to receive notice of the relevant meeting shall not invalidate any resolution passed or any proceeding at any such meeting. Substantial shareholding noti®cation Bye-Law 192(B) For so long as the shares of the Company are listed on the Designated Stock Exchange, each Shareholder shall, upon becoming a substantial shareholder of the Company, give an undertaking to the Company that, for so long as he remains a substantial shareholder of the Company, he shall notify the Secretary of the particulars of the shares bene®cially owned by him as at the end of each calendar month. For the purpose of this Bye-Law 192 (B), the term ``substantial shareholder'' shall mean a person who bene®cially owns ®ve per cent. (5%) or more of the total number of issued shares of the Company at the relevant time. A-10 ANNEX A SUMMARY OF BERMUDA COMPANY LAW The Company is incorporated in Bermuda and therefore, operates subject to Bermuda law. Set out below is a summary of certain provisions of Bermuda company law, which does not purport to contain all applicable quali®cations and exemptions and does not purport to be a complete review of all matters of Bermuda company law or a comparison of provisions that may differ from the laws of other jurisdictions, with which interested parties may be more familiar. 1. SHARE CAPITAL The Bermuda Act provides for the giving of ®nancial assistance by a company for the acquisition of its own or its holding company's shares in speci®c circumstances. The Bermuda Act provides that where a company issues shares at a premium whether for cash or otherwise, a sum equal to the aggregate amount or value of the premium on those shares shall be transferred to an account, to be called ``the share premium account'' and the provisions of the Bermuda Act relating to a reduction of share capital shall, except as provided in section 40 of the Bermuda Act, apply as if the share premium account were paid up share capital of the company. An exception is made to this rule in the case of an exchange of shares where the excess value of the shares acquired over the nominal value of the shares being issued may be credited to a contributed surplus account of the issuing company. Contributed surplus is a North American concept recognised under the generally accepted accounting principles of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants which accounting principles are applied in Bermuda. The Bermuda Act permits a company to issue preference shares and under certain circumstances to convert those preference shares into redeemable shares. 2. ALTERATION OF SHARE CAPITAL A company may if authorised by a general meeting of the shareholders of the company and by its bye-laws, alter the conditions of its memorandum of association to increase its share capital, divide its shares into several classes and attach thereto respectively any preferential, deferred, quali®ed or special rights, privileges or conditions, consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of a larger amount than is ®xed by the memorandum of association, make provision for the issue and allotment of shares which do not carry any voting rights, cancel shares which have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person, diminish the amount of its share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled and change the currency denomination of its share capital. With the exception of an increase in capital, cancellation of shares and redenomination of currency of capital, there are no ®ling requirements for any of the above-mentioned alterations. Furthermore, a company may, if authorised by a general meeting of the shareholders, reduce its share capital. There are certain requirements, including a requirement prior to the reduction to publish a notice in an appointed newspaper stating the amount of the share capital as last determined by the company, the amount to which the share capital is to be reduced and the date on which the reduction is to have effect. The Bermuda Act provides that a company shall not reduce the amount of its share capital if on the date the reduction is to be effected there are reasonable grounds for believing that the company is, and after the reduction would be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due. The Bermuda Act includes certain protections for holders of special classes of shares, requiring their consent to be obtained before their rights may be varied. B-1 ANNEX B The Bermuda Act requires that as soon as practicable after the allotment of any of its shares a company must complete and have ready for delivery share certi®cates in relation to those shares allotted unless the conditions of issue of the shares otherwise provide. A certi®cate under the common seal of the company shall be prima facie evidence of the title of the shareholder to the shares. The Bermuda Act prohibits bearer shares. 3. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PURCHASE SHARES OF A COMPANY OR ITS HOLDING COMPANY A company is prohibited from providing ®nancial assistance for the purpose of an acquisition of its own or its holding company's shares. However, in certain circumstances, the prohibition from giving ®nancial assistance may be excluded such as where the company's principal purpose in giving that assistance is not to give it for the purpose of any such acquisition, or the giving of the assistance for that purpose is but an incidental part of some larger purpose of the company, and the assistance is given in good faith in the interests of the company. In addition, a company is only prohibited from granting ®nancial assistance if on the date from which the ®nancial assistance is to be given, there are reasonable grounds for believing that the company is, or after the giving of such ®nancial assistance would be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due. 4. PURCHASE BY THE COMPANY OF ITS OWN SHARES AND WARRANTS The Bermuda Act permits the company, if authorised to do so by its memorandum of association or by its bye-laws, to purchase its own shares. It should be noted that the company is authorised by its bye-laws, subject to certain approvals, to purchase its own shares. Such purchases may only be effected out of the capital paid up on the purchased shares, pro®ts otherwise available for dividend or distribution (see ``Dividends and distributions'' below) or out of the proceeds of a new issue of shares made for the purpose. Any premium payable on a repurchase over the par value of the shares to be repurchased must be provided for out of the pro®ts otherwise available for dividends, out of the company's share premium account, or out of contributed surplus. A purchase by the company of its own shares may be authorised by its board of directors or otherwise by or in accordance with the provisions of its bye-laws. The Bermuda Act provides that no purchase by the company of its own shares may be effected if, on the date on which the purchase is to be effected, there are reasonable grounds for believing that the company is, or after the purchase would be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due. The shares purchased pursuant to the Bermuda Act shall be treated as cancelled and the amount of the company's issued capital shall be diminished by the nominal amount of those shares accordingly. It shall not be taken as reducing the amount of the company's authorised share capital. The company is not prevented from purchasing and may purchase its own warrants. There is no requirement of Bermuda Law that the company's memorandum of association or its bye-laws contain a speci®c enabling provision authorising any such purchase and the directors may rely upon the general power contained in its memorandum of association to buy and sell and deal in personal property of all kinds. A company has power to hold and purchase shares of its holding company. A distinction must be drawn between the purchase of shares in the holding company by the holding company itself and the purchase by a subsidiary. A holding company can only purchase its own shares in accordance with the provisions referred to above. When a subsidiary acquires shares in its holding company, the shares, once purchased, may be voted by the subsidiary for its own bene®t. B-2 ANNEX B 5. TRANSFER OF SECURITIES Title to securities of companies whose securities are traded or listed on an appointed stock exchange may, where permitted by regulations made by the Minister or where such transfer is effected through the mechanism required or permitted by an appointed stock exchange, be evidenced and transferred without a written instrument. 6. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS The Bermuda Act provides that a company shall not declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of contributed surplus, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that (a) the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or (b) the realisable value of the company's assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts. Contributed surplus for these purposes is de®ned as including proceeds arising from donated shares, credits resulting from the redemption or conversion of shares at less than the amount set up as nominal capital, the excess value of shares acquired over those issued in a share exchange should the Board elect to treat it as such and donations of cash and other assets to the company. 7. CHARGES ON THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY The Bermuda Act established a register of charges at the of®ce of the Registrar of Companies permitting any charges on the assets of a company to be registered. Registration is not mandatory but does govern priority in Bermuda, giving a registered charge priority over any subsequently registered charge and over all unregistered charges save those in effect prior to the coming into effect of the Bermuda Act in July 1983. The register of charges is available for inspection by members of the public. The Bermuda Act also makes provision for the registration of a series of debentures. 8. MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION The management and administration of a Bermuda company is essentially governed by Part VI of the Bermuda Act and provides that the management and administration of a Bermuda company shall be vested in the hands of not less than two (2) directors duly elected by the shareholders. The Bermuda Act requires that a Bermuda company maintain either (a) a Bermuda resident secretary and a Bermuda resident representative; or (b) a Bermuda resident secretary and a Bermuda resident director; or (c) two (2) Bermuda resident directors, all of whom must be individuals. Exempted companies, the shares of which are listed on an appointed stock exchange, may appoint a resident representative in Bermuda in place of the other Bermuda resident of®cers, who or which may be either an individual or a corporate entity, whose statutory right, duties and obligations are established by the Bermuda Act. The Bermuda Act contains no speci®c restrictions on the power of the directors to resolve to dispose of assets of a company although it speci®cally requires that every of®cer (which includes a director and managing director and secretary) of a company, in exercising his powers and discharging his duties, shall act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances. Furthermore, it requires that every of®cer should comply with the Bermuda Act, regulations passed pursuant to the Bermuda Act and the bye-laws of the company. B-3 ANNEX B 9. ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE BERMUDA ACT The Bermuda Act requires that a company shall cause to be kept proper records of account with respect to:± (a) all sums of money received and expended by the company and the matters in respect of which the receipt and expenditure take place; (b) all sales and purchases of goods by the company; and (c) the assets and liabilities of the company. It further requires that the records of account shall be kept at the registered of®ce of the company or at such other place as the Board thinks ®t and shall at all times be open to inspection by the directors. The Bermuda Act also requires that, these records of account also be maintained at the of®ce of the resident representative where the company is listed on an appointed stock exchange and the company has appointed a resident representative. There is a proviso in the Bermuda Act to the effect that if the records of account are kept at some place outside Bermuda, there shall be kept at an of®ce of the company in Bermuda such records as will enable the Board to ascertain with reasonable accuracy the ®nancial position of the company at the end of each three (3) month period. Power is vested in the courts of Bermuda to order the company to make available the records of account to any of the directors of the company should the company for some reason refuse to do so. Furthermore, the Bermuda Act imposes a ®ne in the event of failure to comply with the aforementioned requirements which ®ne is limited to the sum of BD$500.00 (approximately equivalent in value to US$500.00), for the time being. 10. AUDITING REQUIREMENTS The Bermuda Act requires that the board of every company shall, at least once in every year, lay before the company in general meeting:± (a) financial statements for the period, which shall include:± (a1) a statement of the results of operations for such period; (a2) a statement of retained earnings or deficits; (a3) a balance sheet at the end of such period; (a4) a statement of changes in the financial position for the period; (a5) notes to the financial statements; (a6) such further information as required by the Bermuda Act and the company's memorandum of association and its bye-laws; (b) the report of the auditor in respect of the financial statements described above based upon the results of the audit made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and (c) the notes referred to in paragraph (a5) above shall include a description of the generally accepted accounting principles used in the preparation of the ®nancial statements and where the accounting principles used are those of a country or jurisdiction other than Bermuda the notes shall disclose this fact and shall name the country or jurisdiction. Financial statements to be laid before the shareholders in general meeting shall be signed on the balance sheet by two (2) of the directors of the company. If for some reason it becomes impossible, for reasons beyond the reasonable control of the directors, to lay the ®nancial statements before the shareholders, it shall be lawful for the meeting to adjourn the meeting for a period of up to ninety (90) days or such longer period as the shareholders may agree. B-4 ANNEX B All shareholders of a company are entitled to receive a copy of the ®nancial statements prepared in accordance with the aforementioned requirements, at least seven (7) days before the general meeting of the company at which the ®nancial statements would be tabled. There are certain exceptions in the case of shareholders not entitled to receive notices of general meetings, joint holders of shares or where the address for a person is not known to the company. The Bermuda Act also makes provision vesting power in the shareholders in general meeting to waive the laying of the ®nancial statements and auditors' report and to waive the appointment of an auditor. In order to do so, it is required that all shareholders and directors of the company agree either in writing or at a general meeting, that in respect of a particular interval no ®nancial statement or auditors' report thereon need be laid before a general meeting. The Bermuda Act contains speci®c requirements in section 89 in relation to the appointment and disquali®cation of an auditor. By way of general reference, the provisions of sections 83, 84, 87, 88, 89 and 90 govern the preparation and maintenance of accounting records and audited ®nancial statements. 11. EXCHANGE CONTROL Although incorporated in Bermuda, the company has been classi®ed as non-resident in Bermuda for exchange control purposes by the Bermuda Monetary Authority. Accordingly, the company may convert currency (other than Bermudian currency) held for its account to any other currency without restriction. Persons, ®rms or companies regarded as residents of Bermuda for exchange control purposes require speci®c consent under the Exchange Control Act 1972 of Bermuda, and regulations thereunder, to purchase or sell shares or warrants of the company which are regarded as foreign currency securities by the Bermuda Monetary Authority. Under the terms of the consent given to the company by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, the issue of shares pursuant to this document and any transactions in issued shares between persons, ®rms or companies regarded as non-resident in Bermuda for exchange control purposes may be effected without further permission from that Authority. Before the company can issue any further shares beyond the consent given from the Bermuda Monetary Authority, the company must ®rst obtain the prior written consent of that Authority. In granting such permission, the Bermuda Monetary Authority accepts no responsibility for the ®nancial soundness of any proposals or for the correctness of any statements made or opinions expressed in this document with regard to them. 12. TAXATION In Bermuda, there are no taxes on pro®ts, income or dividends, nor is there any capital gains tax, estate duty or death duty. Pro®ts can be accumulated and it is not obligatory for a company to pay dividends. The company is required to pay an annual government fee (the ``Government Fee''), which is determined on a sliding scale by reference to a company's authorised share capital and share premium account, with the minimum fee being BD$1,780 and the maximum BD$27,825 (the BD$ is treated at par with the US$). The Government Fee is payable at the end of January in every year and is based on the authorised share capital and share premium account as they stood at 31 August in the preceding year. B-5 ANNEX B The Bermuda Government has enacted legislation under which the Minister of Finance is authorised to give an assurance to an exempted company or a partnership that, in the event of there being enacted in Bermuda any legislation imposing tax computed on pro®ts or income or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, then the imposition of any such tax shall not be applicable to such entities or any of their operations. In addition, there may be included an assurance that any such tax or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, shall not be applicable to the shares, debentures or other obligations of such entities. This assurance has been obtained by the company for a period ending 28 March 2016. 13. STAMP DUTY The law relating to stamp duties has been fundamentally changed as a result of the enactment of certain legislation that came into force on 1 April 1990. Stamp duty is no longer chargeable in respect of the incorporation, registration or licensing of an exempted company, nor, subject to certain minor exceptions, on their transactions. Accordingly, no stamp duty will be payable on the increase in or the issue or transfer of the share capital of the company. 14. LOANS TO DIRECTORS The Bermuda Act prohibits the making of loans by the company to any of its directors or to their families or companies in which they hold a 20 per cent. interest, without the consent of shareholders of the company holding in the aggregate not less than nine-tenths (9/10) of the total voting rights of all shareholders having the right to vote at any meeting of the shareholders of the company. These prohibitions do not apply to anything done to provide a director with funds to meet expenditure incurred or to be incurred by him for the purposes of the company, provided that the company gives its prior approval at a general meeting or, if not, the loan is made on condition that it shall be repaid within six (6) months of the next annual general meeting if the loan is not approved at such meeting. If the approval of the company is not given for a loan, the directors who authorised it will be jointly and severally liable for any loss arising. 15. THE INVESTIGATION OF THE AFFAIRS OF A COMPANY AND THE PROTECTION OF MINORITIES The Bermuda Act makes speci®c provision with regard to the foregoing and provides that the Minister of Finance may, at any time of his own volition, appoint one or more inspectors to investigate the affairs of an exempted company and to report thereon in such manner as he may direct. The Bermuda Act requires that such an investigation be conducted in private unless the company requests that it be held in public. Furthermore, any shareholder of a company who complains that the affairs of the company are being conducted or have been conducted in a manner oppressive or prejudicial to the interests of some part of the shareholders, including himself, or where a report has been made to the Minister of Finance under the foregoing, the Registrar on behalf of the Minister, may make an application to the court by petition for an order that the company's affairs are being conducted or have been conducted in a manner oppressive or prejudicial to the interests of some part of the shareholders and that to wind up the company would unfairly prejudice that part of the shareholders but otherwise the facts would justify the making of a winding up order on the ground that it would be just and equitable that the company should be wound up. If the court is of this opinion, then it may, with a view to bringing to an end the matters complained of, make such order as it thinks ®t whether for regulating the conduct of the company's affairs in future or for the purchase of shares of any shareholders of the company by other shareholders of the company or by the company and in the case of a purchase by the company, for the reduction accordingly of the company's capital, or otherwise. B-6 ANNEX B Class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of Bermuda; however, the Bermuda courts ordinarily would expect to follow English case law precedent which would permit a shareholder to commence an action in the name of the company to remedy a wrong done to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of the company or is illegal or would result in the violation of a company's memorandum of association and bye-laws. Furthermore, consideration would be given by the court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or, for instance, where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of the company's shareholders than that which actually approved it. In addition to the above, the shareholders may be able to bring claims against a company; such claims must, however, be based on the general laws of contract or tort applicable in Bermuda. A statutory right of action is conferred on subscribers to shares of a company against persons (including directors and of®cers) responsible for the issue of a prospectus in respect of damage suffered by reason of an untrue statement therein (see above) but this confers no right of action against the company itself. In addition, the company itself (as opposed to its shareholders) may take action against the of®cers (including directors) for breach of their statutory and ®duciary duty to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company (as mentioned above). 16. INSPECTION OF CORPORATE RECORDS Members of the general public have the right to inspect the public documents of the company available at the of®ce of the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda which will include the company's certi®cate of incorporation, its memorandum of association (including its objects and powers) and any alteration to the company's memorandum of association and documents relating to an increase or reduction of authorised capital. The shareholders have the additional right to inspect the bye-laws of the company, minutes of general (i.e. shareholders) meetings and audited ®nancial statements of the company, which must be presented to the annual general meeting of shareholders. The register of shareholders of the company is also open to inspection by shareholders without charge, and to members of the general public for a fee. The company is required to maintain its share register in Bermuda but may establish a branch register outside Bermuda. The company is required to keep at its registered of®ce a register of its directors and of®cers which is open for inspection by members of the public without charge. 17. WINDING UP AND LIQUIDATION PROVISIONS OF BERMUDA LEGISLATION (a) Introduction The winding up of Bermuda companies is governed by the provisions of the Bermuda Act and by the Companies (Winding Up) Rules 1982 (the ``Rules'') and may be divided into the following two types:± (a1) Voluntary winding up which commences with the shareholders' resolution or upon the happening of a specified event (fixed or limited life company) and which itself can be sub-divided into a shareholders' voluntary winding up and a creditors' voluntary winding up; and (a2) Compulsory winding up, by petition presented to the courts of Bermuda followed by winding up order. B-7 ANNEX B (b) Voluntary winding up (b1) Shareholders' voluntary winding up A shareholders' voluntary winding up is only possible if a company is solvent. A Statutory Declaration of Solvency to the effect that a company is able to meet its debts within twelve (12) months from the date of the commencement of its winding up is sworn by a majority of the company's directors and ®led with the Registrar of Companies. A general meeting of shareholders is then convened which resolves that the company be wound up voluntarily and that a liquidator (responsible for collecting in the assets of the company, determining its liabilities and distributing its assets amongst its creditors and the surplus to the shareholders) be appointed. Once the affairs of the company are fully wound up, the liquidator prepares a full account of the liquidation which he then presents to the company's shareholders at a general meeting called for that purpose. This special general meeting must be advertised in an appointed newspaper in Bermuda at least one (1) month before it is held and within one (1) week after it is held, the liquidator noti®es the Registrar of Companies that the company has been dissolved. (b2) Creditors' voluntary winding up A creditors' voluntary winding up may occur where a company is insolvent and a Declaration of Solvency cannot be sworn. A board meeting is convened which resolves to recommend to the shareholders of the company that the company be placed into a creditors' voluntary winding up. This recommendation is then considered and, if thought ®t, approved at a special general meeting of the company's shareholders and, subsequently, at a meeting of the company's creditors. Notice of the creditors' meeting must appear in an appointed newspaper on at least two (2) occasions and the directors must provide this meeting with a list of the company's creditors and a full report of the position of the company's affairs. At their respective meetings, the creditors and shareholders are entitled to nominate a person or persons to serve as liquidator(s) and whose responsibilities include collecting in the assets of the company, ascertaining its liabilities and distributing its assets rateably amongst its creditors in accordance with their proofs of debt. In addition to the liquidator, the creditors are entitled to appoint a Committee of Inspection which, under Bermuda Law, is a representative body of creditors who assist the liquidator during the liquidation. As soon as the affairs of the company are fully wound up, the liquidator prepares his ®nal account explaining the liquidation of the company and the distribution of its assets which he then presents to the company's shareholders in a special general meeting and to the company's creditors in a meeting. Within one (1) week after the last of these meetings, the liquidator sends a copy of the account to the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda who proceeds to register it in the appropriate public records and the company is deemed dissolved three (3) months after the registration of this account. B-8 ANNEX B (c) Compulsory winding up The courts of Bermuda may wind up a Bermuda company on a petition presented by persons speci®ed in the Bermuda Act and which include the company, itself and any creditor or creditors of the company (including contingent or prospective creditors) and any shareholder or shareholders of the company. Any such petition must state the grounds upon which the Bermuda court has been asked to wind up the company and may include either one of the following:± (c1) that the company has by resolution resolved that it be wound up by the Bermuda court; (c2) that the company is unable to pay its debts; (c3) that the Bermuda court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable that the company be wound up. The winding up petition seeks a winding up order and may include a request for the appointment of a provisional liquidator. Prior to the Winding Up Order being granted and the appointment of the provisional liquidator, (who under Bermuda Law, may or may not be the Of®cial Receiver Ð a Government appointed of®cer) an interim provisional liquidator may be appointed to administer the affairs of the company with a view to its winding up until he is relieved of these duties by the appointment of the provisional liquidator. (Often, the interim provisional liquidator is appointed the provisional liquidator). As soon as the Winding Up Order has been made, the provisional liquidator summons separate meetings of the company's creditors and shareholders in order to determine whether or not he should serve as the permanent liquidator or be replaced by some other person who will serve as the permanent liquidator and also to determine whether or not a Committee of Inspection should be appointed and, if appointed, the shareholders of that Committee. The provisional liquidator noti®es the Court of the decisions made at these meetings and the Court makes the appropriate orders. A permanent liquidator's powers are prescribed by the Act and include the power to bring or defend actions or other legal proceedings in the name and on behalf of the company and the power to carry on the business so far as may be necessary for the bene®cial winding up of the company. His primary role and duties are the same as a liquidator in a creditors' voluntary winding up i.e. to distribute the company's assets rateably amongst its creditors whose debts have been admitted. As soon as the affairs have been completely wound up, the liquidator applies to the courts of Bermuda for an order that the company be dissolved and the company is deemed dissolved from the date of this order being made. Any person wishing to have a detailed summary of Bermuda company law or advice on the differences between it and the laws of any jurisdiction with which he is more familiar is recommended to seek independent legal advice.

The Scheme is proposed on the basis that it is important to acknowledge the contribution or potential contribution, which is essential to the well-being and prosperity of the Group, made by these categories of persons. The Company, by adopting the Scheme, will give these categories of persons a real and meaningful stake in the Company at no direct cost to its pro®tability and will help to achieve the following objectives:± (a) the motivation of participants to optimise standards and ef®ciency and to maintain a high level of contribution; (b) the retention of key Group Employees whose contributions are important to the long-term growth and prosperity of the Group; C-3 ANNEX C (c) the recruitment of key Group Employees whose contributions will be important to the long- term growth and prosperity of our Group; and (d) the development of a participatory style of management which instills loyalty and a stronger sense of identi®cation with the long-term prosperity of our Group. 4. Eligibility 4.1 The following persons shall be eligible to participate in the Scheme at the absolute discretion of the Committee:± (a) Group Employees (i) con®rmed full-time employees of the Company and/or its subsidiaries who have attained the age of 21 years on or before the Offering Date; (ii) directors of the Company and/or its subsidiaries who perform an executive function; (iii) non-executive directors of the Company; and (iv) employees who qualify under sub-paragraph (i) above and are seconded to a company in the Parent Group, or an Associated Company, or any other company outside the Group in which the Company and/or Group has an equity interest.

The grant of an Option must be accepted by completing, signing and returning the Acceptance Form in, or substantially in, the form set out in Schedule B, subject to such modi®cation as the Committee may from time to time determine, accompanied by payment of HK$1.00 as consideration. 7.3 If a grant of an Option is not accepted in the manner as provided in Rule 7.2, such offer shall, upon the expiry of the Acceptance Period, automatically lapse and become null, void and of no effect. 8. Subscription Price 8.1 Subject to any adjustment pursuant to Rule 12, the Subscription Price for each Share in respect of which a Market Price Option is exercisable shall be at a price (the ``Market Price'') equal to the average of the last dealt prices for a Share, as determined by reference to the daily of®cial list or any other publications published by the SGX-ST, for the ®ve consecutive Market Days immediately preceding the Offering Date of that Option, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. 8.2 Subject to any adjustment pursuant to Rule 12, the Subscription Price for each Share in respect of which an Incentive Option is exercisable shall be determined by the Committee at its absolute discretion, and ®xed by the Committee at a price which is set at a discount to the Market Price (as determined in accordance with Rule 8.1), provided that:± (a) the maximum discount shall not exceed 20% of the Market Price (or such other percentage or amount as may be prescribed or permitted for the time being by the SGX-ST). In determining the quantum of such discount, the Committee shall take into consideration such criteria as the Committee may, in its absolute discretion, deem appropriate including but not limited to:± (i) the performance of the Company and the Group; (ii) the individual performance of the Participant; and (iii) the contribution of the Participant to the success and development of the Company and/or the Group; and (b) the prior approval of the shareholders of the Company in general meeting shall have been obtained for the making of offers and grants of Options under the Scheme at a discount not exceeding the maximum discount as aforesaid (for the avoidance of doubt, such prior approval shall be required to be obtained only once and, once obtained, shall, unless revoked, authorise the making of offers and grants of Options under the Scheme at such discount for the duration of the Scheme), rounded up to the nearest whole cent. 8.3 In no event shall the Subscription Price be less than the nominal value of a Share. Where the Subscription Price (as determined under Rule 8.1 or, as the case may be, Rule 8.2) is less than the nominal value of a Share, the Subscription Price shall be the nominal value. C-6 ANNEX C 9. Rights to exercise Options 9.1 Subject as provided in this Rule 9 and Rule 10 and any other conditions as may be introduced by the Committee from time to time, each Option shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, during the option period as follows:± (a) in the case of a Market Price Option, a period commencing after the ®rst anniversary of the Offering Date and expiring on the 10th anniversary of such Offering Date, provided that in the case of a Market Price Option which is granted to a Participant not holding a salaried of®ce or employment in the Group or, as the case may be, the Parent Group, such option period shall expire on the 5th anniversary of such Offering Date; and (b) in the case of an Incentive Option, a period commencing after the second anniversary of the Offering Date and expiring on the 10th anniversary of such Offering Date, provided that in the case of an Incentive Option which is granted to a Participant not holding a salaried of®ce or employment in the Group or as the case may be, the Parent Group, such option period shall expire on the 5th anniversary of such Offering Date. 9.2 In the event of an Option being exercised in part only, the balance of the Option not thereby exercised shall continue to be exercisable in accordance with the Scheme until such time as it shall lapse in accordance with the Scheme. 9.3 An Option shall, to the extent unexercised, immediately lapse without any claim against the Company:± (a) subject to Rules 9.4, 9.5 and 9.7, upon the Participant ceasing to be in the full-time employment of the Group, the Parent Group or an Associated Company, as the case may be, for any reason whatsoever; (b) upon the bankruptcy of the Participant or the happening of any other event which results in his being deprived of the legal or bene®cial ownership of such Option; (c) in the event of any misconduct on the part of the Participant as determined by the Committee in its discretion; or (d) in the event that the Committee shall, at its discretion, deem it appropriate that such Option granted to a Participant shall so lapse on the grounds that any of the objectives of the Scheme (as set out in Rule 3) have not been met. For the purpose of Rule 9.3(a), the Participant shall be deemed to have ceased to be so employed as of the earlier of the date the notice of resignation of employment or the cessation of his employment/appointment with the Group, the Parent Group or an Associated Company, as the case may be. 9.4 If a Participant ceases to be employed by the Group, the Parent Group or an Associated Company, as the case may be, by reason of his:± (a) ill health, injury or disability (in each case, evidenced to the satisfaction of the Committee); (b) redundancy; (c) retirement at or after the legal retirement age; or (d) retirement before the legal retirement age with the consent of the Committee, or any other reason approved in writing by the Committee, he may exercise any unexercised Options within the relevant Option Period. C-7 ANNEX C 9.5 If a Participant dies and at the date of his death holds any unexercised Option, such Option may, at the discretion of the Committee, be exercised by the duly appointed personal representatives of the Participant within the relevant Option Period. 9.6 If, for any reason whatsoever, a Participant, being a Parent Group Employee or Associated Company Employee by virtue of his being a non-executive director of any member of the Parent Group or Associated Company on the Offering Date, ceases to be a director of such member of the Parent Group or Associated Company, any Option then held by him shall, to the extent unexercised, immediately lapse without any claim against the Company, unless otherwise determined by the Committee in its absolute discretion. In exercising such discretion, the Committee may also determine the period during which such Option may continue to be exercisable, provided that such period may not in any event exceed the Exercise Period applicable to such Option. 9.7 If, for any reason whatsoever, a Participant, being a Group Employee by virtue of his being an executive or non-executive Director of the Group on the Offering Date, ceases to be an executive director or, as the case may be, non-executive director of the Group, all Options granted to such Participant will, notwithstanding such cessation, continue to be exercisable within the relevant Option Period after such Participant ceases to be Director of the Group. 10. Take-over and winding up of the Company 10.1 Notwithstanding Rule 9 but subject to Rule 10.5, in the event of a take-over being made for the Shares, a Participant (including Participants holding Options which are then not exercisable pursuant to the provisions of Rule 9.1) shall be entitled to exercise in full or in part any Option held by him and as yet unexercised, in the period commencing on the date on which such offer is made or, if such offer is conditional, the date on which such offer becomes or is declared unconditional, as the case may be, and ending on the earlier of:± (a) the expiry of six months thereafter, unless prior to the expiry of such six-month period, at the recommendation of the offeror and with the approvals of the Committee and the SGX-ST, such expiry date is extended to a later date (in either case, being a date falling not later than the expiry of the Option Period relating thereto); or (b) the date of expiry of the Option Period relating thereto, whereupon the Option then remaining unexercised shall lapse and become null and void. Provided that if during such period, the offeror becomes entitled or bound to exercise rights of compulsory acquisition under the provisions of the Act and, being entitled to do so, gives notice to the Participants that it intends to exercise such rights on a speci®ed date, the Option shall remain exercisable by the Participant until the expiry of such speci®ed date or the expiry of the Option Period relating thereto, whichever is earlier. Any Option not so exercised shall lapse provided that the rights of acquisition or obligations to acquire shall have been exercised or performed, as the case may be. If such rights or obligations have not been exercised or performed, the Option shall, notwithstanding Rule 9, remain exercisable until the expiry of the Option Period relating thereto. 10.2 If under the Act, the court sanctions a compromise or arrangement proposed for the purposes of, or in connection with, a scheme for the reconstruction of the Company or its amalgamation with another company or companies, each Participant (including Participants holding Options which are then not exercisable pursuant to the provisions of Rule 9.1) shall be entitled, notwithstanding Rule 9 but subject to Rule 10.5, to exercise any Option then held by him during the period commencing on the date upon which the compromise or arrangement is sanctioned by the court and ending either on the expiry of sixty (60) days thereafter or the date upon which the compromise or arrangement becomes effective, C-8 ANNEX C whichever is later (but not after the expiry of the Option Period relating thereto), whereupon the Option shall lapse and become null and void. 10.3 If an order is made for the winding-up of the Company on the basis of its insolvency, all Options, to the extent unexercised, shall lapse and become null and void. 10.4 In the event of a members' voluntary winding-up (other than for amalgamation or reconstruction), the Participants (including Participants holding Options which are then not exercisable pursuant to the provisions of Rule 9.1) shall be entitled, within thirty (30) days of the passing of the resolution of such winding-up (but not after the expiry of the Option Period relating thereto), to exercise any unexercised Option, after which such unexercised Option shall lapse and become null and void. 10.5 If in connection with the making of a general offer referred to in Rule 10.1 or the scheme referred to in Rule 10.2 or the winding-up referred to in Rule 10.4, arrangements are made (which are con®rmed in writing by the Auditors, acting only as experts and not as arbitrators, to be fair and reasonable) for the compensation of Participants, whether by the continuation of their Options or the payment of cash or the grant of other options or otherwise, a Participant holding an Option, as yet not exercised, may not, at the discretion of the Committee, be permitted to exercise that Option as provided for in this Rule 10. 10.6 To the extent that an Option is not exercised within the periods referred to in this Rule 10, it shall lapse and become null and void. 11. Exercise of Options 11.1 An Option may be exercised, in whole or in part, by a Participant giving notice in writing to the Company in, or substantially in, the form set out in Schedule C, subject in each case to such modi®cation as the Committee may from time to time determine. Such notice must be accompanied by a remittance for the Aggregate Subscription Cost in respect of the Shares for which that Option is exercised and any other documentation the Committee may require. An Option shall be deemed to be exercised upon receipt by the Company of the said notice, duly completed, the relevant documentation required by the Committee and the Aggregate Subscription Cost. 11.2 All payments made shall be made by cheque, cashiers' order, banker's draft or postal order made out in favour of the Company or such other mode of payment as may be acceptable to the Company. 11.3 Subject to such consents or other required action of any competent authority under any regulations or enactments for the time being in force as may be necessary and subject to the compliance with the terms of the Scheme and the Memorandum of Association and Bye-Laws of the Company, the Company shall, within ten (10) Market Days after the exercise of an Option, allot the relevant Shares and within ®ve (5) Market Days from the date of the allotment of the relevant Shares, despatch to CDP the relevant share certi®cates by ordinary post or such other mode as the Committee may deem ®t. 11.4 The Company shall, as soon as practicable after such allotment, apply to the SGX-ST (and any other stock exchange on which the Shares are quoted or listed) for permission to deal in and for quotation of such Shares. 11.5 Shares which are allotted on the exercise of an Option by a Participant shall be issued in the name of CDP to the credit of the securities account of that Participant maintained with CDP, the securities sub-account maintained with a Depository Agent or the CPF investment account maintained with a CPF agent bank. C-9 ANNEX C 11.6 Shares allotted and issued on exercise of an Option shall be subject to all the provisions of the Memorandum of Association and Bye-Laws of the Company, and shall rank pari passu for all entitlements, save for any dividends or other distributions declared or recommended in respect of the then existing Shares, the Record Date for which falls on or before the relevant exercise date of the Option. ``Record Date'' means the date ®xed by the Company for the purposes of determining entitlements to dividends or other distributions to or rights of holders of Shares. 11.7 The Company shall keep available suf®cient unissued Shares to satisfy the full exercise of all Options for the time being remaining capable of being exercised. 12. Variation of Capital 12.1 If a variation in the issued ordinary share capital of the Company (whether by way of a capitalisation of pro®ts or reserves or rights issue, reduction, subdivision, consolidation or distribution) shall take place:± (a) the Subscription Price for the Shares, the nominal amount, class and/or number of Shares comprised in an Option to the extent unexercised; and/or (b) the nominal amount, class and/or number of Shares over which Options may be granted under the Scheme, shall be adjusted by the Committee to give each Participant the same proportion of the equity capital of the Company as that to which he was previously entitled and, in doing so, the Committee shall determine at its own discretion the manner in which such adjustment shall be made. 12.2 Unless the Committee considers an adjustment to be appropriate:± (a) the issue of securities as consideration for an acquisition or a private placement of securities; or (b) the cancellation of issued Shares purchased or acquired by the Company by way of a market purchase of such Shares undertaken by the Company on the SGX-ST during the period when a share purchase mandate granted by shareholders of the Company (including any renewal of such mandate) is in force, shall not normally be regarded as a circumstance requiring adjustment. 12.3 Notwithstanding the provisions of Rule 12.1:± (a) no such adjustment shall be made if as a result, the Subscription Price shall fall below the nominal amount of a Share and if such adjustment would, but for this paragraph (a), result in the Subscription Price being less than the nominal amount of a Share, the Subscription Price payable shall be the nominal amount of a Share; and (b) any determination by the Committee as to whether to make any adjustment and if so, the manner in which such adjustment should be made, must (except in relation to a capitalisation issue) be con®rmed in writing by the Auditors (acting only as experts and not as arbitrators) to be in their opinion, fair and reasonable. 12.4 Upon any adjustment required to be made pursuant to this Rule 12, the Company shall notify the Participant (or his duly appointed personal representatives where applicable) in writing and deliver to him (or his duly appointed personal representatives where applicable) a statement setting forth the Subscription Price thereafter in effect and the nominal value, class and/or number of Shares thereafter to be issued on the exercise of the Option. Any adjustment shall take effect upon such written noti®cation being given. C-10 ANNEX C 13.

Modi®cations to the Scheme 15.1 Any or all the provisions of the Scheme may be modi®ed and/or altered at any time and from time to time by resolution of the Committee, except that:± (a) no modi®cation or alteration shall alter adversely the rights attaching to any Option granted prior to such modi®cation or alteration except with the consent in writing of such number of Participants who, if they exercised their Options in full, would thereby become entitled to not less than three-quarters in nominal amount of all the Shares which would fall to be allotted upon exercise in full of all outstanding Options; (b) the de®nitions of ``Group'', ``Group Employee'', ``Parent Company'', ``Parent Group'', ``Parent Group Employee'', ``Associated Company'', ``Associated Company Employee'', ``Controlling Shareholder'', ``Participant'', ``Committee'', ``Option Period'' and ``Subscription Price'' and the provisions of Rules 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11.1, 11.6, 12, 13 and this Rule 15 shall not be altered to the advantage of Participants except with the prior approval of the Company's shareholders in general meeting; and (c) no modi®cation or alteration of the provisions of this Scheme which have been previously approved by the SGX-ST shall be made without the prior approval of the SGX-ST, or any other stock exchange on which the Shares are quoted or listed, and no modi®cation or alteration of the provisions of this Scheme shall be made without the prior approval of such other regulatory authorities as may be necessary. 15.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Rule 15.1, the Committee may at any time by resolution (and without other formality, save for the prior approval of the SGX-ST) amend or alter the Scheme in any way to the extent necessary to cause the Scheme to comply with any statutory provision or the provision or the regulations of any regulatory or other relevant authority or body (including the SGX-ST). 15.3 Written notice of any modi®cation or alteration made in accordance with this Rule 15 shall be given to all Participants. 16. Terms of employment unaffected The terms of employment of a Participant (who is a Group Employee) shall not be affected by his participation in the Scheme, which shall neither form part of such terms nor entitle him to take into account such participation in calculating any compensation or damages on the termination of his employment for any reason. 17. Duration of the Scheme 17.1 The Scheme shall continue to be in force at the discretion of the Committee, subject to a maximum period of ten (10) years commencing on the Adoption Date, provided always that the Scheme may continue beyond the above stipulated period with the approval of the Company's shareholders by ordinary resolution in general meeting and of any relevant authorities which may then be required.

C-18 ANNEX C TAXATION The following is a discussion of certain tax matters arising under the current tax laws in Singapore and Bermuda and is not intended to be and does not constitute legal or tax advice. While this discussion is considered to be a correct interpretation of existing laws in force as at the date of this Prospectus, no assurance can be given that courts or ®scal authorities responsible for the administration of such laws will agree with this interpretation or that changes in such laws will not occur. The discussion is limited to a general description of certain tax consequences in Singapore and Bermuda with respect to ownership of the Shares by Singapore investors, and does not purport to be a comprehensive nor exhaustive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase the Shares. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers regarding Singapore and Bermuda tax and other tax consequences of owning and disposing the Shares. It is emphasised that neither our Company, our Directors nor any other persons involved in the Invitation accepts responsibility for any tax effects or liabilities resulting from the subscription for, purchase, holding or disposal of the Shares. Dividends payable by our Company on the Shares will be declared and paid to shareholders in Hong Kong dollars. BERMUDA TAXATION Our Company is incorporated in Bermuda. Dividends remitted to shareholders resident outside Bermuda will not be subject to withholding tax. Further details are set out under ``Annex B Ð Summary of Bermuda Company Law'' on pages B-1 to B-9 of this Prospectus. SINGAPORE TAXATION Cash dividends Foreign source dividends paid to a Singapore resident individual will only be liable to tax in Singapore to the extent that they are received or deemed received in Singapore. The rate of tax will vary according to the individual's circumstances but is subject to a current maximum rate of 26.0% with effect from the Year of Assessment 20021. Dividends paid by a foreign company to a company in Singapore will only be liable to tax to the extent that they are received or deemed received in Singapore. Dividend received through the CDP system by investors who are not resident in Singapore may be subject to tax in Singapore. Corporate income tax in Singapore is currently at 24.5% with effect from the Year of Assessment 20021. Bonus issues and scrip dividends Under current Singapore tax law and practice, a capitalisation of pro®ts followed by the issue of new shares, credited as fully paid, pro rata to shareholders (``bonus issue'') does not represent a distribution of dividends by a company to its shareholders. Therefore, a Singapore resident shareholder receiving shares by way of a bonus issue should not have a liability to Singapore tax. When a dividend is to be satis®ed wholly or in part in the form of an allotment of ordinary shares credited as fully paid, the dividend declared will be treated as income subject to Singapore tax. Similarly, when shareholders are given the right to elect to receive an allotment of ordinary shares credited as fully paid in lieu of cash, the dividend declared will be treated as dividend income and be subject to Singapore tax. 1 The partial tax exemption on a company's normal chargeable income with effect from the Year of Assessment 2002 will not apply to Singapore dividends which will be taxed at 24.5%. D-1 ANNEX D Capital gains There is no tax on capital gains in Singapore. However, the acquisition and disposal of investments by certain investors, in particular ®nancial institutions, may be part of their normal business activities and, in these circumstances, the gains or losses arising may be taken into account for tax purposes. Stamp duty There is no stamp duty payable in respect of the new issuance and holding of shares. Where existing shares are acquired in Singapore, stamp duty is payable on the instrument of transfer of the shares at the rate of S$2.00 for every S$1,000.00 of the consideration for, or market value of, the shares, whichever is higher. The stamp duty is borne by the purchaser unless there is an agreement to the contrary. Where an instrument of transfer is executed outside Singapore or no instrument of transfer is executed, no stamp duty is payable on the acquisition of existing shares. Stamp duty may be payable if the instrument of transfer is received in Singapore. As a temporary measure in response to the current economic downturn in Singapore, the Singapore Government announced on 12 October 2001 that stamp duty would be reduced by 30% on all chargeable instruments executed between 13 October 2001 and 31 December 2001. Goods and Services Tax (``GST'') The sale of the Shares by an investor belonging in Singapore through an SGX-ST member or to another person belonging in Singapore is an exempt sale not subject to GST. Where the Shares are sold by the investor to a person belonging outside Singapore, the sale is generally a taxable sale subject to GST at zero-rate. Any GST incurred by a GST-registered investor in the making of this supply in the course of furtherance of a business is claimable as a refund from the Comptroller of GST. Services such as brokerage, handling and clearing services rendered by a GST-registered person to an investor belonging in Singapore in connection with the investor's purchase, sale or holding of the Shares will be subject to GST at the current rate of 3.0%.

An applicant without an existing Securities Account with CDP in his own name at the time of his application will have his application rejected, in the case of an application by way of an Application Form, or will not be able to complete his Electronic Application, in the case of an Electronic Application. An applicant with an existing Securities Account who fails to provide his Securities Account number or who provides an incorrect Securities Account number in section B of the Application Form or in his Electronic Application, as the case may be, is liable to have his application rejected.

If the address of an applicant stated in the Application Form or, in the case of an Electronic Application, in the records of the relevant Participating Bank, is different from the address registered with CDP, the applicant must inform CDP of his updated address promptly, failing which the noti®cation letter on successful allotment and other correspondence from the CDP will be sent to his address last registered with CDP.

This will be the only acknowledgement of application monies received and is not an acknowledgement by the Company.

This authorisation applies to applications made by way of Application Forms and by way of Electronic Applications. 12.

In the event of an under-subscription for Offer Shares as at the close of the Application List, the number of Offer Shares under-subscribed shall be made available to satisfy applications for Placement Shares to the extent that there is an over-subscription for Placement Shares as at the close of the Application List. In the event that the Reserved Shares are under-subscribed, that number of Reserved Shares under-subscribed shall be used to satisfy applications for the Placement Shares to the extent that there are excess applications for the Placement Shares as at the close of the Application List or to satisfy applications for the Offer Shares to the extent there is an over-subscription for the Offer Shares as at the close of the Application List. In the event of an under-subscription for Placement Shares as at the close of the Application List, that number of Placement Shares under-subscribed shall be made available to satisfy applications for Offer Shares to the extent that there is an over-subscription for Offer Shares as at the close of the Application List.

ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ELECTRONIC APPLICATIONS Please read carefully the terms of this Prospectus, the procedures and the terms and conditions for Electronic Applications set out below before making an Electronic Application. Any reference to the ``applicant'' in the terms and conditions for Electronic Applications and the Steps shall mean the applicant who applies for New Shares through an ATM of a Participating Bank. An applicant may apply for Offer Shares by way of an Electronic Application. The procedures for applying for Offer Shares by way of an Electronic Application are set out on the ATM screens of the relevant Participating Banks. For illustrative purposes, the procedures for Electronic Applications at ATMs of the OCBC Bank are set out in the ``Steps for an Electronic Application through ATMs of OCBC Bank'' appearing on pages E-12 and E-13 of this Prospectus (the ``ATM Steps'') . The ATM Steps set out the actions that the applicant must take at ATMs of OCBC Bank in order to complete an Electronic Application. The actions that an applicant must take at ATMs of other Participating Banks are set out on the ATM screens of the relevant Participating Banks. An applicant must have an existing bank account with and be an ATM cardholder of one of the Participating Banks before he can make an Electronic Application at the ATMs of that Participating Bank. An ATM card issued by one Participating Bank cannot be used to apply for Offer Shares at an ATM belonging to other Participating Banks. Upon the completion of his Electronic Application transaction, the applicant will receive an ATM transaction slip (``Transaction Record''), con®rming the details of his Electronic Application. The Transaction Record is for retention by the applicant and should not be submitted with any Application Form. An applicant, including one who has a joint bank account with any of the Participating Banks, must ensure that he enters his own Securities Account number when using the ATM card issued to him in his own name. Using his own Securities Account number with an ATM card which is not issued to him in his own name will render his Electronic Application liable to be rejected. An Electronic Application shall be made on and subject to the terms and conditions of this Prospectus including but not limited to the terms and conditions appearing below and those set out under the section on ``TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR APPLICATIONS'' on pages E-1 to E-4 of this Prospectus as well as the Memorandum of Association and Bye-Laws of the Company. # E-8 ANNEX E 1. In connection with his Electronic Application for Offer Shares, the applicant is required to con®rm statements to the following effect in the course of activating his Electronic Application:± (a) that he has received a copy of this Prospectus and has read, understood and agreed to all the terms and conditions of application for Offer Shares in this Prospectus prior to effecting the Electronic Application and agrees to be bound by the same; (b) that he consents to the disclosure of his name, NRIC/passport number, address, nationality, permanent resident status, CDP Securities Account number, CPF investment account number (if applicable) and share application amount (the ``Relevant Particulars'') from his account with that Participating Bank to the Share Registrar, CDP, CPF, SCCS, the Company and the Manager (the ``Relevant Parties''); and (c) that the Electronic Application made is his only application for New Shares (other than for Reserved Shares) and it is made in his own name and at his own risk. His application will not be successfully completed and cannot be recorded as a completed transaction unless he presses the ``Enter'' or ``OK'' or ``Con®rm'' or ``Yes'' key or any other relevant key in the ATM. By doing so, the applicant shall be treated as signifying his con®rmation of each of the 3 statements. In respect of statement 1(b) above, his con®rmation, by pressing the ``Enter'' or ``OK'' or ``Con®rm'' or ``Yes'' key, shall signify and shall be treated as his written permission, given in accordance with the relevant laws of Singapore including Section 47(4) of the Banking Act, Chapter 19 of Singapore to the disclosure by that Participating Bank of the Relevant Particulars to the Relevant Parties. 2. By making an Electronic Application, the applicant con®rms that he is not applying for Offer Shares as nominee of any other person and that any Electronic Application that he makes is the only application made by him as bene®cial owner. The applicant shall make only one Electronic Application for Offer Shares and shall not make any other application for New Shares (other than Reserved Shares), whether at the ATMs of any Participating Bank or on the Application Forms. Where a person has made an application for Offer Shares or Placement Shares (other than Reserved Shares), he shall not make an Electronic Application for Offer Shares. 3. The applicant must have suf®cient funds in his bank account with his Participating Bank at the time he makes his Electronic Application, failing which his Electronic Application will not be completed. Any Electronic Application which does not conform strictly to the instructions set out on the screens of the ATM through which the Electronic Application is being made shall be rejected. 4. The applicant irrevocably agrees and undertakes to subscribe for and to accept the number of Offer Shares applied for as stated on the Transaction Record or any lesser number of Offer Shares that may be allotted to him in respect of his Electronic Application. In the event that the Company decides to allot any lesser number of such Offer Shares or not to allot any Offer Shares to the applicant, the applicant agrees to accept such decision as ®nal. If the applicant's Electronic Application is successful, his con®rmation (by his action of pressing the ``Enter'' or ``OK'' or ``Con®rm'' or ``Yes'' key on the ATM) of the number of Offer Shares applied for shall signify and shall be treated as his acceptance of the number of Offer Shares that may be allotted to him and his agreement to be bound by the Memorandum of Association and Bye- Laws of the Company. E-9 ANNEX E 5. No applications will be kept in reserve. Where an Electronic Application is unsuccessful, the full amount of the application monies will be refunded in Singapore dollars (without interest or any share of revenue or other bene®t arising therefrom) to the applicant by being automatically credited to the applicant's account with his Participating Bank within 3 Market Days after the close of the Application List. Trading on a ``WHEN ISSUED'' basis, if applicable, is expected to commence after such refund has been made. Where an Electronic Application is rejected or accepted in part only, the full amount or the balance of the application monies, as the case may be, will be refunded (without interest or any share of revenue or other bene®t arising therefrom) to the applicant by being automatically credited to the applicant's account with his Participating Bank within 14 days after the close of the Application List. Responsibility for timely refund of application monies from unsuccessful or partially successful Electronic Applications lies solely with the respective Participating Banks. Therefore, you are strongly advised to consult your Participating Bank as to the status of your Electronic Application and/or the refund of any monies to you from an unsuccessful or partially successful Electronic Application, to determine the exact number of Offer Shares allotted to you before trading the Offer Shares on SGX-ST. Neither SGX-ST, the CDP, the SCCS, the Participating Banks, the Company nor the Manager assume any responsibility for any loss that may be incurred as a result of you having to cover any net sell positions or from buy-in procedures activated by the SGX-ST. 6.

The applicant irrevocably agrees and acknowledges that his Electronic Application is subject to risks of electrical, electronic, technical and computer-related faults and breakdowns, ®res, acts of God and other events beyond the control of the Participating Banks, the Company and the Manager and if, in any such event, the Company, the Manager and/or the relevant Participating Bank do not record or receive the applicant's Electronic Application, or data relating to the applicant's Electronic Application or the tape containing such data is lost, corrupted, destroyed or not otherwise accessible, whether wholly or partially for whatever reason, the applicant shall be deemed not to have made an Electronic Application and the applicant shall have no claim whatsoever against the Company, the Manager and/or the relevant Participating Bank for the Offer Shares applied for or for any compensation, loss or damage. 10. The existence of a trust will not be recognised. Any Electronic Application by an applicant must be made in his own name and without quali®cation.

OVERVIEW OF OUR GROUP Our Company was incorporated in Singapore on 8 April 2000 under the Act as a private limited company under the name of Penton Tooling International Pte Ltd which was subsequently changed to Penton International Pte Ltd on 5 September 2000. On 16 April 2001, our Company converted into a public company at which time we changed our name to “Penton International Ltd”. We are principally engaged in the design and manufacture of plastic injection mould tools for a wide array of tooling applications in the automotive, IT and electronics industries. Our operations are complemented by a proactive marketing strategy to promote our services and ensure an earlier involvement into projects. We operate with high speed technologically advanced machines which are able to give precision to two microns and speeds of up to 38,000 rpm. We combine an in-depth knowledge and experience gathered over fifty years, since the incorporation of F.N. Doig Limited in the UK on 20 May 1945, of tool making with advanced manufacturing technologies in the field of plastics injection mould tools. Due to our technical expertise and manufacturing technology, we are well positioned to be a technology based engineering service provider in component design and tool development. Presently, we operate three manufacturing facilities, two in the UK and one in Singapore. The two UK plants are located at High Wycombe, England while our Singapore plant is located at Woodlands. The bulk of our operations are devoted to new tool manufacture while we also cover tool modification work and moulding for short production runs. Our in-house technical centres at our High Wycombe and Woodlands facilities carry out tool design, research work and training activities. In addition, we have set up a research and design centre in the last quarter of FY 2001 at our Singapore headquarters at International Business Park, Jurong. Our plastic injection mould tools are supplied to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), component manufacturers and moulders for the production of vehicle body parts, computer hardware, home appliances and electronics circuit boards. They are widely used across the moulding industry in different moulding applications from the conventional plastic injection moulding up to the more advanced compression tooling and thin wall tooling technology. Our mould tool size ranges from 100 kg to 35,000 kg. The automotive industry which accounted for approximately 64.3 per cent. of our total sales in FY 2001 is our largest market. Currently, we are supporting some of the largest component suppliers and plastic injection moulders such as Johnson Controls, Linpac Mouldings Witton, Hashimoto and Visteon who are suppliers to vehicle manufacturers such as Ford, Jaguar, Volvo and Nissan. The IT and electronics industry is our second largest market. Our tools are employed in the production of computer hardware for the divisions of IBM, Compaq and Digital in Europe. Our operational philosophy is to promote responsiveness to customer needs, flexibility and reduction in lead times between acceptance of an order and final delivery. This has enabled us to attract customers and develop long term working relationships with them. One of our subsidiaries, Penton was awarded the BS EN ISO 9001:1994 certificate by the National Quality Assurance Limited of UK on 23 February 2000 in recognition of our achievement in establishing a quality management system for project management, design and manufacture of mould tools. 15 We have attained significant technological breakthroughs in our collaboration with National Power PLC, a global company operating power stations around the world, in the Regenesys™ energy storage system, which is further described under “New Products/Activities” of this Prospectus. The Regenesys™ energy storage system requires tools that can mould large multifunctional components to accuracy levels demanded by their engineering applications, a criteria which our technologically advanced high speed machines and technical expertise can satisfy. Through this project, we have developed our capabilities to design and manufacture tools for high technology injection and complex compression moulding. Following six years of collaboration with National Power PLC, design works are being carried out for the tooling contracts for the Regenesys™ energy storage system. Our competitive strengths are attributed mainly to our tooling machines and technical expertise. We operate high speed machining centers that can perform high precision cutting to deliver quality surface finishing. Our design team possesses technical expertise gathered over thirty years of experience in the plastic mould tool industry. The advanced machinery coupled with the technical expertise enables us to perform concurrently engineered prototyping, that is, tool designing and production can commence at the same time as our customers develop their products. Our high speed machines coupled with our advanced software enables us to cut and shape steel blocks with greater accuracy in a shorter period of time as compared to conventional machining methods. We will continue to capitalise on forefront technologies, such as integrated CAD/CAM systems and an electronic production tracking system to enhance our product and service quality. Our new site at Lancaster Road, High Wycombe, with its high technology and fully computerised manufacturing facility, is now operational. This will allow us to operate in an environment where tool design data can be distributed electronically throughout the manufacturing facility and increase our flexibility in responding to design modifications. Our facility at Lancaster Road, UK, will specialise in large tooling projects while our plant at Coronation Road, UK, will focus on small to medium-sized tool production. The presence of tool trialing and moulding facilities has created cost savings for our customers by minimising modification requirements. Hence, we have expanded our existing moulding and trialing capacity to cover a wider range of components, so as to provide greater cost savings to our customers. In line with our aim to be a strategic partner to OEMs and component manufacturers, we plan to further expand our technical expertise and design systems in component design at our High Wycombe facilities so as to allow for more involvement with customers during the early stages of product design and development. Our research and design centre at our Singapore headquarters, at International Business Park, Jurong, provides tool design and engineering services through the use of advanced CAD/CAM programmes to support our projects all round the world. It serves as a training ground for developing a skilled pool of design engineers and for building up our technical expertise in Singapore. We intend to develop our Singapore tool manufacturing plant to increase its tooling capability to cover a wider product range. Further, we will be introducing pre-production moulding and trialing to the Singapore plant, which will replicate our UK operations. It will act as our local production arm for tooling orders from Europe with Penton and Vogue as its supporting arm in product servicing and maintenance for our European customers. Turnover generated in FY 1999, FY 2000, FY 2001 and the six months ended 31 October 2001 was $16.4 million, $23.4 million, $24.4 million and $8.0 million respectively. Over the same period, our Group registered profits after tax of $1.3 million, $2.9 million, $3.6 million and a loss of $3,000 respectively. Our registered office and business address is located at 9 International Business Park, #03-00 Texmaco Building, Singapore 609915.

Some of the following risk factors relate principally to our business in general whilst others pertain to the industry in which we operate. If any of the considerations and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, financial conditions, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In such a case, the trading price of our Shares could decline due to any of these risk factors, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our Shares. The continued growth of our business depends on the growth of the automotive sector We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from automotive manufacturers. For FY 2001, turnover and profit before tax from the automotive industry accounted for approximately 64.3 per cent. and 66.2 per cent. of our total turnover and profit before tax respectively. Hence, our growth and profitability are dependent on the demand and supply for motor vehicles, as well as our ability to move up the supply chain to contract directly with the automotive manufacturers. Our revenue growth is dependent on Ford Motor Company Limited We are dependent on Ford for a substantial portion of our business. Most of our tool projects service either the component suppliers or moulders of Ford. On other projects, we contract with Ford directly to provide tools for their component manufacturers. For FY 1999, FY 2000 and FY 2001, turnover generated from tool projects related to vehicles manufactured by subsidiaries owned by Ford accounted for 4.2 per cent., 30.9 per cent. and 27.7 per cent. respectively of our Group’s total turnover. The table below sets out details of the contribution of turnover achieved as a supplier to Ford. FY 1999 FY 2000 FY 2001 Contract as: $’000 $’000 $’000 Tier one supplier — 920 — Tier two supplier(1) 659 4,582 5,375 Tier three supplier (2) 34 1,736 1,397 Total sales to Ford 693 7,238 6,772 Total Group turnover 16,428 23,397 24,424 % turnover contribution from Ford related projects 4.2% 30.9% 27.7% % pre-tax profit contribution from Ford related projects 5.0% 41.2% 26.7% Notes: 1. We supply to tier one suppliers engaged by Ford such as Visteon and Johnson Controls. 2. As a tier three supplier, we supply tools to tier two moulders such as Aeroquip, Alltek, Autoliv, CTP Wipac, Excel, Linpac (Southend) and MPL Key. For details on the relationship between vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, please refer to “Industry Overview and Prospects” as disclosed on pages 47 to 49 of this Prospectus. 19 Risks associated with future acquisitions could adversely affect our financial performance We pursue an expansion strategy centering on strategic and complementary acquisitions to achieve a diversified portfolio of products and an enlarged client base. There are inherent risks associated with such acquisitions including undiscovered weaknesses in operations, problem projects or customers and the diversion of management attention and focus to the new companies. As a result, we may not be able to fully reap the synergistic benefits intended to be realised from the acquisitions. Our failure to manage acquisitions successfully could seriously harm our operating results. Also, acquisition costs and losses arising from the acquisitions could have a material and adverse effect on our financial performance. Inability to develop or access leading technology will affect our profitability We have invested a considerable amount in new technology capital equipment to enhance our service and product performance in meeting our customer requirements. Over the years, we have also upgraded our high-speed cutting machines and CAD/CAM software programmes to raise our work standards and meet more demanding tool requirements of our projects. To improve on our existing tooling facilities as well as to implement new infrastructure, we will require continuous research and development and funding support. If we are unable to develop or introduce enhancements, we may not be able to maintain or improve our performance standards in terms of manufacturing lead times, product conformance and quality. Our inability to develop or introduce enhancements to our products to meet our customers’ requirements could result in the loss of our market share and cause our profits to decline. Production difficulties and delays will affect our product performance and delivery times Our tooling processes require extensive and complex technology. This involves the use of advanced and costly equipment and machinery. Production difficulties or delays may occur in the event of machine breakdowns, capacity constraints and defects in production materials which will adversely affect our business and profit margins. These would result in low machine yields, poor product quality and longer lead times to product delivery. Changes in the political, economic and regulatory conditions in countries where our clients or our facilities are based may have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability Our main tooling facilities serve a client base that spans across Singapore, UK, Germany, USA, Malaysia, Mexico and India. Our clients consist of OEMs, component manufacturers and moulders serving mainly the automotive, IT and electronics industries. The growth and performance of these industries may be affected by the general political, regulatory and economic conditions existing internationally and domestically. Political instability and/or an economic downturn in the countries where our clients operate may cause a reduction in the general consumption of automotive, computer and consumer electronic products produced by them. The reduced demand would cause a reduction in production, resulting in a scaled back commitment of our clients for tooling projects as well as shrinkage in the volume and value of tooling orders. This will in turn cause a reduction in the demand for our products and services. Adverse changes in labour conditions, taxation and duties, interest rates and inflation rates and consumer discretionary spending could also adversely affect our operations and cause our profits to decline. Our future business development is dependent on our key personnel We are highly dependent on our senior management who are responsible for the overall direction and growth of our Group for the past few years. Mr Christopher John Culley, our Chairman and founder, has been primarily responsible for our growth and success. Currently, Mr Culley, together with our Executive Directors and Executive Officers, are responsible for charting the overall strategy, corporate development and business growth of our Group. We believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate our key personnel. In regard to this, we can give no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key personnel or identify and hire additional key personnel. Our inability to replace these key personnel in the long term would affect our Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. 20 Disruption of operations at our manufacturing facilities will have a material adverse impact on our financial performance We carry out our tool manufacturing at our two sites at High Wycombe, UK and one site at Woodlands, Singapore. A fire or other calamity at any of these sites would disrupt our operations and result in significant damages. Purchasing and installing new machines and equipment would incur additional time and costs, and cause our production to be disrupted. Such lost time would lead to reduced production output and lower revenue. This would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Inefficient utilisation of production capacity will have a negative effect on our profitability We are engaged in a capital-intensive business and our operations are characterised by high fixed costs. We incurred an average of $5.2 million per annum on capital investment over the past three financial years. Consequently, insufficient utilisation of installed capacity can have a material negative effect on our profitability. Our ability to maintain or increase our profitability will continue to be dependent upon our ability to maintain high capacity utilisation rates. Capacity utilisation rates may be affected by a number of factors, such as the level of customer orders, the installation of new machines in anticipation of future business, operating inefficiencies, mechanical failure and fire or other natural disasters. Fluctuations in foreign exchange currencies against the S$ could adversely affect our results Our transactions are mainly denominated in Sterling pounds, US dollars and Singapore dollars. Approximately, 73.7 per cent. of our Group’s sales and 66.5 per cent. of our Group’s purchases and operating expenses were made or incurred in £ in FY 2001. The cost of goods and operating expenses of our UK subsidiaries are denominated in £ while the cost of goods and operating expenses of our Singapore headquarters, Singapore subsidiary and design centre are denominated in S$. Our Singapore operations are exposed to foreign exchange risks as part of the revenue stream is derived from overseas markets and denominated in US$ and £. Should the US$ or £ depreciate against the S$, we will suffer foreign exchange losses. Our foreign exchange gains/(losses) are detailed on pages 45 and 46 of this Prospectus. We also trade in Euros with our customers in Europe. Any depreciation in Euros against the £ or S$ will reduce our profits as the absolute amount upon translation to £ or S$ would be lower. In addition, we will be subject to translation differences as the financial results of our UK subsidiaries which are prepared in £, will be translated into S$ for consolidation purposes. The translation differences would arise from fluctuations in the £/S$ exchange rate. Should the S$ appreciate against £, we will experience translation losses. We currently do not have a formal policy with respect to our foreign exchange transactions and have not used any hedging instrument since inception to manage our foreign exchange risk. There has been no prior market for our Shares and this offering may not result in an active or liquid market for these Shares Prior to our initial public offering, there has not been a public market for our Shares. We cannot predict the extent to which a trading market will develop or how liquid that market would become. The Issue Price of our Shares is determined by negotiations between representatives of the Manager and us and may not be indicative of the market price which will prevail in the stock market. The trading prices of our Shares will be subject to fluctuations in response to variations in our announcements of results of operations, changes in general economic conditions, changes in accounting policies or other developments affecting us, our customers or our competitors, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, the operating and stock price performance of other companies and other events or factors. Volatility in the price of our Shares could be caused by factors outside our control and could be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating results. 21 Future sales of our Shares could adversely affect our share price Any future sales or availability of our Shares can have a downward pressure on our share price. The sales of a significant amount of our Shares in the public market after the Placement, or the perception that such sales may occur, could materially adversely affect the market price of our Shares. These factors may also affect our ability to raise funds from the issue of additional equity securities. Except as otherwise described in “Moratorium” (see page 90 of the Prospectus) and “Description of our Shares” (see page 94 of the Prospectus), there will be no restriction on the ability of the substantial shareholders to sell their Shares either on the SGX Sesdaq or otherwise. 22 ISSUE STATISTICS ISSUE PRICE NET TANGIBLE ASSETS NTA per Share based on the audited proforma consolidated NTA of our Group as at 30 April 2001 after adjusting for the First and Second Equity Issue, First and Second Stock Consolidation and Subdivision referred to on pages 24 and 25 of this Prospectus is as follows:- (a) before adjusting for the estimated net proceeds from the Placement and the exercise of the options in respect of 7,257,913 Shares available under the Penton Share Option Scheme (based on the pre-flotation issued share capital of 68,497,030 Shares) (b) after adjusting for the estimated net proceeds from the Placement but before the exercise of the options in respect of 7,257,913 Shares available under the Penton Share Option Scheme (based on the post-flotation issued share capital of 84,497,030 Shares) (c) after adjusting for the estimated net proceeds from the Placement and the exercise of the options in respect of 7,257,913 Shares available under the Penton Share Option Scheme (based on the enlarged issued share capital of 91,754,943 Shares) Premium of the Issue Price over the adjusted NTA per Share as at 30 April 2001:- (a) before adjusting for the estimated net proceeds from the Placement and the exercise of the options in respect of 7,257,913 Shares available under the Penton Share Option Scheme (based on the pre-flotation issued share capital of 68,497,030 Shares) (b) after adjusting for the estimated net proceeds from the Placement but before the exercise of the options in respect of 7,257,913 Shares available under the Penton Share Option Scheme (based on the post-flotation issued share capital of 84,497,030 Shares) (c) after adjusting for the estimated net proceeds from the Placement and the exercise of the options in respect of 7,257,913 Shares available under the Penton Share Option Scheme (based on the enlarged issued share capital of 91,754,943 Shares) EARNINGS Historical audited proforma consolidated net earnings per Share of our Group for FY 2001 before adjusting for the exercise of the options in respect of 7,257,913 Shares available under the Penton Share Option Scheme (based on the pre-flotation issued share capital of 68,497,030 Shares) Historical audited proforma consolidated net earnings per Share of our Group for FY 2001 had the Service Agreements set out on pages 82 to 84 of this Prospectus been in effect for FY 2001(1), after adjusting for the exercise of the options in respect of 7,257,913 Shares available under the Penton Share Option Scheme (based on the pre-flotation issued share capital of 75,754,943 Shares which includes new Shares arising from the exercise of options granted under the Penton Share Option Scheme) 20.5 cents 16.0 cents 15.1 cents 14.8 cents 28.1% 35.8 % 38.5% 5.3 cents 4.4 cents 23 PRICE EARNINGS RATIO Historical audited proforma consolidated price earnings ratio before adjusting for the exercise of the options in respect of 7,257,913 Shares available under the Penton Share Option Scheme (based on the historical net earnings per Share of our Group for FY 2001 and the pre-flotation issued share capital of 68,497,030 Shares) Histor ical audited proforma consolidated price earnings ratio had the Service Agreements set out on pages 82 to 84 of this Prospectus been in effect for FY 2001(1), after adjusting for the exercise of the options in respect of 7,257,913 Shares available under the Penton Share Option Scheme (based on the historical net earnings per Share of our Group for FY 2001 and pre-flotation issued share capital of 75,754,943 Shares which includes new Shares arising from the exercise of options granted under the Penton Share Option Scheme) NET OPERATING CASH FLOW (2) Historical audited proforma consolidated net operating cash flow per Share of our Group for FY 2001 based on the pre-flotation issued share capital of 68,497,030 Shares NET OPERATING CASH FLOW RATIO The ratio of Issue Price to historical net operating cash flow based on the historical proforma consolidated net operating cash flow per Share for FY 2001 Notes:- (1) Had the Service Agreements disclosed on pages 82 to 84 of this Prospectus been in effect for in FY 2001, the aggregate remuneration paid to the Executive Directors would have been approximately $1,387,678 instead of $1,058,890.

As the share premium account is not sufficient to cover the estimated issue expenses, the deficit on the share premium account amounting to approximately $0.1 million will be expensed to the profit and loss account for the financial year ending 30 April 2002. Therefore, our profit before unusual item and taxation for FY2002 will be reduced by approximately $0.1 million. The changes in the issued and paid-up share capital of our Company and subsidiaries in the three years preceeding the date of this Prospectus are set out on page 139 of this Prospectus under “General and Statutory Information”. 27 DIVIDEND POLICY In FY 2001, we have declared dividends of $204,792 to our shareholders whose names appeared in the Register of Members of our Company on 31 July 2001.

Future dividends (if any) will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, as long as there are funds legally available for that distribution. Any such dividend payments will depend on a number of factors, including:- l our results of operations, cash flows and financial conditions; l our future prospects; and l other factors deemed relevant by our Directors. Past dividends paid are not necessarily reflective of future dividend payments.

This table should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Prospectus and the section entitled “Review of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” as set out on pages 35 to 43 of this Prospectus. As at 31 October 2001 As Adjusted for Actual the Placement $ $ Cash and cash equivalents (2,944,556) (1,164,556) Indebtedness Current Hire-purchase creditors 1,440,023 1,440,023 Secured long term debt, current portion 1,081,578 1,081,578 2,521,601 2,521,601 Non-current Hire-purchase creditors 4,669,844 4,669,844 Secured long-term debt 5,876,032 5,876,032 10,545,876 10,545,876 Total Indebtedness 13,067,477 13,067,477 Shareholders’ equity: Fully paid, outstanding share capital 8,219,642 10,139,644 Reserves 3,061,151 3,061,151 Total Capitalisation 11,280,793 13,200,795 As at 31 October 2001, we had total bank borrowings of $6.2 million comprising $3.3 million in secured loans and $2.9 million in net overdraft. The Fixed Rate Secured Loan Notes for an aggregate amount of approximately £1.4 million (approximately $3.6 million) at an annual interest of 14.5 per cent. was obtained by CAC from the Murray Johnstone Venture Capital Trusts in October 1999, repayable in tranches over three years from 31 October 2004. CAC is currently negotiating with Aberdeen Murray Johnstone Private Equity, the manager of the Murray Johnstone Venture Capital Trusts, on the restructuring of the Fixed Rate Secured Loan Notes. As at the date of this Prospectus, no agreement or understanding has been reached on the revised repayment dates of the Fixed Rate Secured Loan Notes. In any case, the Murray Johnstone Venture Capital Trusts have agreed that unless there is an event of default, they will not require any of the repayments to be rescheduled to a date which is prior to 31 December 2002. 30 CAC has declared ordinary dividends of £225,511 (or $604,933, based on an exchange rate of $1 to £0.3728) on 22 August 2000 and £84,567 (or $224,145, based on exchange rate of S$1 to £0.3773) on the 241,902 “A” ordinary shares in CAC held by the Murray Johnstone Venture Capital Trusts and the Murray Johnstone Venture Capital Trusts have waived the interest due to them for the period from 22 October 1999 to 30 April 2001 under the Fixed Rate Secured Loan Notes. Based on our shareholders’ equity of $11.3 million and long term portion of bank borrowings of $2.2 million as at 31 October 2001, our gearing ratio stood at 0.19 times. After taking into account the Fixed Rate Secured Loan Notes of $3.6 million, our gearing ratio would be 0.52 times. We have been able to service our loan repayment commitments on a timely basis. Encumbrances On 28 September 2001, CAC, Penton, Tool Teck and Vogue (the “Companies”) each entered into a mortgage debenture in respect of all their assets and undertakings in favour of HSBC Bank plc. (“HSBC”) to secure all monies and liabilities owing by the Companies to HSBC from time to time. As at 31 October 2001, an aggregate total of $4.6 million was owed by the Companies to HSBC. The Companies have also entered into composite guarantees to guarantee the payment of each others’ liabilities to HSBC. CAC has created debentures in respect of all their assets and undertakings in favour of the Murray Johnstone Venture Capital Trusts to secure payments due to them by CAC. These debentures were created in connection with the $3.6 million Fixed Rate Secured Loan Notes entered into by CAC in favour of the Murray Johnstone Venture Capital Trusts. Atech entered into a Deed of Assignment dated 15 June 2000 with OUB whereby Atech assigned to OUB by way of mortgage all its estate rights title and interest in the lease and property at Unit #01-03, 2 Woodlands Sector 1, Singapore 738068, which was purchased at $1.9 million to secure all credit and other banking facilities for which Atech may be indebted to OUB from time to time. Please refer to “Property, Plant and Equipment” on pages 70 and 71 of the Prospectus for more details on the property. As at 31 October 2001, Atech had credit facilities with OUB amounting to $2.1 million and also had outstanding hire-purchase arrangements and loans in respect of its machinery and equipment amounting to about $0.1 million. These borrowings are secured by corporate guarantees from our Company. As at 31 October 2001, our Company has credit facilities with OUB amounting to $750,000. The facilities are secured against a personal guarantee of Mr Christopher John Culley. Save as disclosed above, we had no other borrowings or indebtedness in the nature of borrowings including bank overdrafts and liabilities under acceptances (other than normal trading bills) or acceptance credits, mortgages, charges, hire purchase commitments, guarantees and other material contingent liabilities as at 31 October 2001. 31 DILUTION Dilution is the amount by which the Issue Price in this Placement exceeds our NTA per Share after the Placement. NTA value per Share is determined by subtracting our total liabilities from the total book value of our tangible assets and dividing the differences by the number of ordinary shares deemed to be outstanding on the date as of which the book value is determined. The audited proforma consolidated NTA per Share as at 30 April 2001 before adjusting for the net proceeds from the Placement and based on the pre-flotation issued and paid-up share capital of 68,497,030 Shares was 16.0 cents. Pursuant to the Placement in respect of 16,000,000 Placement Shares at the Issue Price of $0.205 per Share, our Group’s NTA per Share after adjusting for the estimated net proceeds from the Placement and based on the post-flotation issued and paid-up share capital of 84,497,030 Shares would have been 15.1 cents. This represents an immediate decrease in NTA per Share of 0.9 cents per Share or approximately 5.6 per cent. to our existing shareholders and an immediate dilution in NTA per Share of 5.4 cents per Share or approximately 26.3 per cent. to our new investors. The following table illustrates the dilution per share:- As at 30 April 2001 Cents Cents Issue Price 20.5 NTA per Share as at 30 April 2001, based on the pre-flotation issued share capital of 68,497,030 Shares 16.0 Decrease in NTA per Share attributable to existing investors (0.9) NTA per Share after the Placement 15.1 Dilution in NTA per Share to new public investors 5.4 The following table summarises as at 30 April 2001 after adjusting for the First and Second Equity Issue and the First and Second Stock Consolidation and Subdivision, the total number of Shares issued by us, the total consideration paid by us and the average price paid per Share by our existing shareholders and by our new public investors in the Placement.

Sales of plastic injection mould tools to the automotive and the IT and electronics industry collectively accounted for approximately 97.7 per cent. of our turnover in FY 2001. The plastic injection moulding industry is a derived-demand industry, which depends on the performance of manufacturing sectors such as the automotive and the IT and electronics sectors. The growth of the above market sectors is dependent on consumer purchasing power and general economic conditions. Any significant decline in the demand for products of the above market sectors will result in a lower production level which will translate into lower sales volume and profits for us. As we service clients from the different continents of Europe, North and Central America, and Asia, any changes in political, economic and regulatory environment affecting the automotive, IT and electronics industries in the above mentioned regions will have significant impact on our business and operating results. See “Risk Factors” for more details on this factor. Our ability to secure new contracts is largely attributable to our ability to provide prompt and reliable services in mould tool designing and manufacturing, plastic injection moulding process and concurrently engineered prototyping techniques. We believe that we compete based on the quality of our mould tools. Our ability to deliver products of quality standard lies on our technology investment and capacity. In addition, the industrial knowledge and network connections of our management also play a role in our customer relationship management. Cost of Sales Our cost of sales comprises mainly direct labour costs, purchases, raw materials and depreciation on plant and machinery. It constitutes approximately $14.1 million or 70.2 per cent. of our total costs for FY 2001. Total costs include cost of sales and total operating expenses. Direct labour costs account for approximately 60.3 per cent. of our cost of sales for FY 2001. Direct labour costs comprise salaries of our design engineers, CAM programmers, tool engineers and machinists engaged on the production floor. Any shortage of skilled labour will lead to an increase in direct labour costs. Purchases comprise mainly raw materials and sub-contracting costs. Raw materials include steel, hot runner systems and other ancillary parts. Any shortage in raw materials will result in an increase in purchasing costs. Sub-contracting costs are dependent on quotation by and negotiation with third parties. Purchases account for approximately 29.5 per cent. of our cost of sales for FY 2001. All our purchases of raw materials are transacted in £ for our UK operations and S$ for our Singapore operations. Our other cost of sales of approximately 10.2 per cent. relates mainly to depreciation expense for our plant and machinery. Operating expenses Our indirect costs constitute $6.0 million or 29.8 per cent. of our total costs for FY 2001. The indirect costs consist of indirect labour and related costs (including directors’ remuneration and wages of staff from the sales and marketing department, accounts and administrative department), factory expenses such as repairs and maintenance, rental, utilities charges and operating lease rentals, transportation and general expenses. The largest indirect cost component is indirect labour costs which represents 9.6 per cent. of our total costs. Our indirect costs will be adversely affected if staff remuneration, charges and rates for utilities were to increase. Other indirect costs also include finance expenses such as interest expense which accounted for 3.8 per cent. of our total costs. 36 Segmental Results Our turnover and pre-tax profits are derived mainly from the automotive and the IT and electronics industries. Revenue is derived from new tool manufacture and tool modification and repair carried out for customers in Europe, Asia as well as North and Central America. Our turnover and profitability are dependent on the production level and growth of the above sectors.

This was a result of our investment programme in upgrading machine technology as well as building a skilled work force to increase our ability to manufacture substantial packages of tools. This has enhanced our competitive position as equipment manufacturers and component suppliers are seeking to distribute their projects across fewer suppliers due to the need for control and closer monitoring over their products. Turnover for our IT and electronics sector business dipped slightly by $0.5 million to $8.8 million. Sales to this sector by our UK subsidiaries dropped by 53.6 per cent. or $3.0 million as many of our MNC customers turned to placing tool orders with Asian tool manufacturers. Our decline in sales by our UK subsidiar ies was offset by the increase in sales in the same sector by our Singapore subsidiary, Atech of $2.5 million, from $3.7 million in FY 1999 to $6.2 million in FY 2000. The growth in our North and Central American market was attributed to the increased sales of IT and electronics products which offset the decline in sales from Europe. Tool orders from customers in North and Central America increased as a result of our marketing effort in the US and Mexican markets. Cost of sales Cost of sales increased by $4.6 million or 45.7 per cent.. Purchases increased by 104.5 per cent. with the increase in automotive sales, from $5.7 million to $12.9 million. Labour costs had also increased by $1.4 million with the introduction of an additional shift and the recruitment of more CNC machinists to operate the large CNC machines for the production of automotive tools. Depreciation had also increased in line with the additional plant and machinery amounting to $4.0 million acquired during the year. We have also made a provision of approximately $1.0 million for foreseeable losses on a contract. Operating expenses Operating expenses increased by approximately $0.7 million mainly due to an increase in selling and marketing expenses of $0.4 million and increase in administrative and general expenses of $1.2 million, partly offset by a decrease in finance expense of $0.2 million and an increase in other income of $0.7 million. Selling and marketing expenses increased by $0.4 million mainly due to the increase in directors’ remuneration. The increase of $0.3 million was due to more directors being appointed during the year as well as higher bonus paid which was in line with the higher profit for the year. The higher selling expenses were also due to the higher entertainment and travelling expenses of $0.1 million, which was incurred to source for more projects, which was in line with the increase in turnover of $7.0 million. Administrative and general expenses increased by $1.2 million mainly due to increase in the write off on the negative goodwill of $0.4 million, increase in office expenses of $0.3 million, increase in depreciation expense of $0.3 million and increase in bad debts expense and insurance of $0.2 million. Negative goodwill arises from the acquisition of Tool Teck Limited and Penton Tools Limited on 17 July 1996 and 17 October 1997 respectively, which were to be written back over a period of four years. On 1 May 1998, Tool Teck was dissolved, resulting in the balance of the negative goodwill of $0.4 million in additional to the annual charge of $0.2 million being written back to the accounts in FY 1999. Consequently, negative goodwill written back in FY 2000 was only $0.2 million as compared to $0.6 million in FY 1999. Office expenses increased by $0.3 million, attributed by a $0.2 million increase in salaries and other staff-related expenses as a result of the higher number of staff as well as a $0.03 million once off relocation cost of one of our directors from South Wales to High Wycombe. With the 39 new additions to the computers, leasehold improvements and motor vehicles amounting to $0.5 million, depreciation has also increased by $0.3 million. Bad debts expense for FY 2000 amounted to $0.09 million, comprising bad debts written off of $0.08 million and doubtful debts provision of $0.01 million as compared to $0.03 million that was recovered in FY 1999. Insurance expenses have also increased by $0.05 million with the newly acquired assets coming under insurance protection. Financing expenses dropped by $0.2 million despite an increase in capital expenditure of $6.4 million. The increase in hire purchase interest of $0.09 million was more than fully offset by the expiry of the operating lease of $0.2 million. The operating lease involved was not renewed as the acquisition of Penton provided us with additional machines. Bank interest also decreased by $0.1 million with lower bank overdraft balances. An amount of approximately $0.3 million was declared by CAC as dividend in FY 2000 in lieu of interest payable under the Fixed Rate Secured Loan Notes (please refer to “Dividend Policy” on page 27 for more details). Had the amount been classified as an interest expense, our Group’s financing expense would have been increased by $0.3 million and our Group’s profit before tax would have been reduced by $0.3 million. Other income arose from the sale of fixed assets and quoted investments. Profit before tax Profit before tax for the automotive segment expanded by more than 128 per cent. to $1.6 million as a result of the economies of scale from the higher contract value even though its gross margin had declined. The profit before tax for the IT and electronic segment posted an 80 per cent. increase to $1.5 million due to more attractive gross margins obtained. Sales from our North and Central American, and Asian markets generated better profit margins which further contributed to our improved profitability. Profit after tax Profit after tax increased to $2.9 million, after deducting the tax charge of $0.6 million. FY 2000 to FY 2001 Turnover Turnover showed an increase of 4.4 per cent or $1.0 million to $24.4 million mainly due to an increase in sales from the automotive division of $2.8 million, partly offset by a reduction in sales from the IT and electronics and others division of $0.6 million and $1.2 million respectively. The increase in sales from the automotive sector was mainly due to fulfilment of existing and new orders from repeat customers for new moulds. The automotive division also secured orders from new customers during the year. In order to support the increase in orders from the automotive division for automotive tools, we utilised the production capacity of the Singapore subsidiary and another UK subsidiary, which resulted in a drop in turnover in the IT and electronics sector by $0.6 million and others sector by $1.2 million. Turnover in the European markets showed an increase of $1.6 million as one of our existing customers’ related company located in Germany placed their orders with us directly in FY 2001 instead of via their UK counterparts. Turnover to the Singapore and North and Central American markets also showed an increase of $0.4 million and $0.4 million respectively as customers place orders to manufacture tools for their new products, which was partially offset by the decrease in turnover of $0.5 million to the other Asian markets. Cost of Sales Cost of sales decreased by $0.5 million mainly due to provisions for contract losses of $1.0 million made in FY 2000 for foreseeable loss on a contract. There were no provisions for contract losses made in FY 2001. This was partially offset by higher cost of sales of $0.5 million incurred in current year as a result of higher turnover achieved in FY 2001. 40 Operating expenses Operating expenses increased by $0.6 million from $5.4 million to $6.0 million due to an increase in administrative and general expenses of $0.3 million and an increase in other expenses of $0.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in selling and marketing expenses of $0.3 million and decrease in finance expenses of $0.2 million. Administrative and general expenses increased by $0.3 million mainly due to cost incurred in relation to the relocation of two of our production facilities and relocation of our managing director from UK to Singapore. Other expenses resulted mainly from disposal of investment and fixed assets. Selling and marketing expenses decreased by $0.3 million mainly due to a reduction in directors’ remuneration as two of our directors at the subsidiaries level resigned. One of the directors retired while the other resigned on his own accord to pursue his own interest. Finance expenses decreased by $0.2 million due to a decrease in operating lease rental as new assets are bought to replace the leased ones. An amount of approximately $0.5 million was declared by CAC as dividend in FY 2001 in lieu of interest payable under the Fixed Rate Secured Loan Notes (please refer to “Dividend Policy” on page 27 for more details). Had the amount been classified as an interest expense, our Group’s financing expense would have been increased by $0.5 million and our Group’s profit before tax would have been reduced by $0.5 million. Profit before tax Profit before tax for the automotive segment expanded by more than 81 per cent. to $2.9 million in line with the higher turnover. This has led to an increase in profit margin by 22.6 per cent to 17.9 per cent of turnover. This has also resulted in an improvement in profitability of turnover to the UK sector by 69.7 per cent to 20.2 per cent of turnover as the UK sector is mainly made up of sales to the automotive sector, which yields a higher gross profit margin. Profit after tax Profit after tax increased by $0.8 million after deducting a tax charge of $0.8 million. Audited six months ended 31 October 2000 vs unaudited six months ended 31 October 2001 Turnover Turnover decreased by $3.5 million or 30.6 per cent. as compared to the six months ended 31 October 2000. Automotive sales, which are undertaken by the UK subsidiaries, decreased by $4.8 million or 62.2 per cent. as projects were delayed by our customers. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in the IT and electronics segments by $1.3 million or 35.6 per cent. mainly due to a project undertaken by our Group. Sales to the UK region fell by $1.9 million mainly caused by the drop in the automotive sector, which was partially offset by an increase in sales in the IT and electronics segment. Sales to the Singapore and North and Central American market showed a decrease of $1.9 million as the capacity of the Singapore subsidiary was taken up by sub-contract work from the UK. Cost of Sales Cost of sales decreased by $1.6 million or 22.8 per cent. which was in line with the decrease in turnover, offset by lower decrease in direct labour costs due to reduction in headcount and higher depreciation charge. Direct labour cost decreased by only 18.2 per cent. as compared to the decrease in turnover of 30.6 per cent. as it takes time to reduce the workforce. Our Group has reduced the staff strength progressively from 178 in April 2001 to 112 in October 2001. Depreciation increased slightly due to the full year impact of the depreciation for machineries purchased in FY2001. 41 Operating expenses Overall, operating expenses increased by $0.3 million or 9.2 per cent. despite a drop in turnover. The increase was mainly caused by the increase in financing cost of $0.3 million and increase in administrative and general expenses of $0.1 million, offset by a decrease in selling and marketing expenses of $0.1 million mainly due to a reduction in Directors’ remuneration. Finance expenses increased by $0.3 million mainly due to the interest of $0.3 million payable on the Fixed Rate Secured Loan Notes. Previously, dividend was declared in lieu of interest. Profit before tax Profit before tax decreased by $2.1 million as a result of lower turnover for the period coupled with a higher interest expense. Profit before tax of $0.7 million was generated by our UK subsidiaries with a loss of $0.7 million being incurred in Singapore. Our UK subsidiaries benefited from other income of $0.3 million resulting from the sale of fixed assets following the rationalisation of the UK operations. Profit after tax Taxation was not provided for the period ended 31 October 2001. REVIEW OF FINANCIAL POSITION Fixed Assets Fixed assets consist of leasehold properties, plant & machinery, fixtures, computers and motor vehicles. The net book value of the assets showed an increase of $3.8 million from $13.0 million in FY 1999 to $16.8 million in FY 2000. In FY 2000, acquisitions amounted to $6.4 million for the purchase of leasehold property in Singapore as well as additional machinery. With a depreciation charge of $1.8 million and disposal of $0.3 million, net book value of fixed assets increased by $3.9 million, after adjusting for a translation loss of $0.4 million. In FY 2001, the group incurred $2.0 million in fitting out the two new leasehold properties purchases in FY 2000. Another $6.0 million was incurred in acquiring new machines, computer, furniture and motor vehicles. With a depreciation charge of $2.0 million and translation loss of $0.6 million, net book value of fixed assets increased by $5.4 million. For the six months ended 31 October 2001, net book value of our fixed assets decreased by $0.3 million due to a depreciation charge of $0.8 million. This was partially offset by additions to plant and machinery for the new factories in Singapore and the UK amounting to $0.2 million and translation difference of $0.3 million. Quoted Investments In FY 2000, quoted investment increased from $0.4 million to $0.9 million with the net purchase of $0.5 million during the year. In FY 2001, the amount decreased by $0.9 million due to disposal of the investments to cut further losses in view of the poor market conditions. Intangible Assets Intangible assets relate to the negative goodwill that arises on consolidation for the subsidiaries and development costs incurred on our projects. For the six months ended 31 October 2001, intangible assets increased by S$3.2 million as a result of goodwill from acquisition arising from recording of deferred tax in the subsidiaries in accordance with the new accounting standard. Current Assets In FY 2000, total current assets balance increased by $4.6 million from $5.8 million to $10.4 million. The increase was mainly due to a higher trade debtors’ balance as well as the higher projects-in- progress in excess of progress billings. The increase in trade debtors, from $4.8 million to $6.6 million, was due to the higher turnover. Projects-in-progress in excess of progress billings also increased by $2.3 million with more projects uncompleted as at end of the financial year 2000. These projects are mainly automotive projects received towards the end of the financial year, which required a longer 42 period to complete compared with the IT and electronics projects. Uncompleted IT and electronics projects have also increased with turnover increasing for the year. Other debtors balance increased by $0.5 million to $1.0 million with $0.4 million of expenditure relating to the listing, such as professional fees, travelling and research cost carried forward and $0.1 million of property taxes prepaid. Total current assets continued to increase in FY 2001 from $10.4 million to $14.8 million. The increase was mainly attributed to the higher projects-in-progress in excess of progress billings of $3.5 million, partially offset by the lower trade debtors of $1.8 million. This was because most of the projects are uncompleted and hence, not ready to be billed according to the progress billing schedule. Some of the trade debts were settled close to the year end resulting in the cash balances to rise by $1.4 million. Other debtors and prepayments has also increased by $1.2 million with the additional expenditure of $1.2 million incurred on the listing exercise. For the six months ended 31 October 2001, current assets decreased by $0.5 million mainly due to decrease in trade debtors of $1.6 million and amount recoverable on contract of $0.7 million. This was partially offset by an increase in bank balances of $1.0 million, and an increase in prepayments and other debtors of $0.8 million. The decrease in trade debtors and projects-in-progress in excess of progress billings was due to a lower turnover for the period while the increase in prepayments and other debtors was mainly due to tax recoverable. Current Liabilities In FY 2000, current liabilities increased by $1.6 million to $10.5 million. The bulk of the increase was due to the increase in other creditors and hire-purchase creditors. Other creditors increased by $2.2 million to $4.0 million, with $1.6 million payable for the leasing of the factory in Woodlands, Singapore. Another $0.6 million was due to higher dividends payable. Hire-purchase creditors increased by $0.6 million, from $1.4 million to $2.0 million with new hire purchase financing taken up for the capital expenditure of $6.4 million. Provision for taxation has also increased by $0.3 million to $0.5 million due to the higher tax charge in line with increase in profit for the year. The increase was partly offset by the decrease in bank overdraft of $1.7 million, from $3.4 million to $1.7 million. The balance of the increase was due to the bank loan of $0.3 million taken up to finance the operations. In FY 2001, current liabilities increased by $3.3 million to $13.8 million. Bank overdraft, bank loan and hire-purchase creditors increased by $1.9 million, $0.9 million and $0.5 million respectively to part finance the capital expenditure of $8.0 million incurred during the year. Trade creditors balances increased by $0.6 million due to longer repayment terms obtained from suppliers as well as higher purchases for mould bases made towards the end of the year. Other creditors and accruals have decreased by $1.1 million due to cost of property purchase of $1.6 million transferred to term loan, offset by higher dividend payable of $0.2 million and accrued listing expenses of $0.3 million. Provision for income tax has also increased by $0.3 million while amount due to directors increased by $0.1 million. We have also received progress billing in excess of projects-in-progress for some of the projects for the amount of $0.1 million. Total current liabilities decreased by $0.2 million, from $13.8 million in FY2001 to $13.6 million for the six months ended 31 October 2001. Trade creditors decreased by $0.9 million due to lower purchases in line with lower turnover. Other creditors decreased by $0.5 million due to payments for the purchase of machines, partially offset by current year’s interest accrued on the Fixed Rate Secured Loan Notes, as well as accrued listing expenses. Hire-purchase creditors decreased by $1.0 million due to repayments during the period, resulting in higher bank overdraft balance. Provision for income tax decreased by $0.3 million due to payments during the period, offset by higher progress billing in excess of projects-in-progress of $0.3 million. Non Current Liabilities Non current liabilities increased by $4.6 million to $8.8 million in FY 2000 mainly due to the increase in term loans of $3.4 million, with the additional term loan of $3.8 million taken up during the year to finance the operations, offset by repayments during the year. The balance of hire-purchase creditors also increased by $1.2 million due to the capital acquisition of $6.4 million during the year, which was partly financed through hire purchase arrangements. 43 In FY 2001, non current liabilities increased by $3.5 million from $8.8 million to $12.3 million. This was due to the additional loans of $1.2 million and hire purchase of $1.4 million taken up by our subsidiaries. Advance from directors has also increased by $0.9 million due to unpaid dividend. For the six months ended 31 October 2001, non current liabilities increased by $2.5 million due to provision for deferred tax during the period. Shareholders’ funds Shareholders’ funds increased from $5.1 million in FY 1999 to $8.4 million in FY 2000 mainly due to profit retained for the respective years, the capital injection of $1.2 million into CAC and $0.4 million into Atech in FY 2000. Shareholders’ funds increased by $2.4 million from $8.4 million to $10.8 million due to profit retained for the year ended 30 April 2001 after deducting proposed dividend of $0.9 million. Shareholders equity increased by $0.1 million from $10.8 million in FY2001 to $10.9 million for the six months ended 31 October 2001 due to increase in translation reserve. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Condensed Summary of Cash Flows Audited Financial Year ended 30 April Unaudited six months ended 1999 2000 2001 31 October 2001 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Net cash provided by operating 792 2,216 3,743 469 activities Net cash provided by/(used in) (617) (6,270) (7,306) 116 investing activities Net cash provided by/(used in) (1,315) 5,826 3,030 (1,792) financing activities Net increase/ (decrease) in cash (1,140) 1,772 (533) (1,207) and cash equivalents Our cash is generated from our design and mould tool manufacturing services as well as from loans and hire purchases facilities. Besides meeting working capital requirements, the cash generated has been used for financing our expansion and production capacity. In FY 1999, our cash position worsened by $1.1 million due to cash used in financing and investing activities of $1.3 million and $0.6 million respectively, offset by cash generated from operations of $0.8 million. The funds are mainly used for the net repayment of loans of $1.1 million as well as to finance the capital expenditure of $1.1 million incurred during the year. Our cash position improved by $1.8 million in FY 2000 mainly due to cash generated by operating activities of $2.2 million and financing activities of $5.8 million, partially offset by funds used in investing activities of $6.3 million. The increase in cash generated by operating activities was mainly derived from cash contr ibution from our Singapore subsidiary which enjoyed a big increase in turnover of approximately 75.3 per cent. Cash generated from our Singapore operations is mainly derived from the IT and electronics sector which contributed about 80.7 per cent. of the total turnover of our Singapore operations. The cash is used to part finance the fixed asset acquisitions of $6.4 million. The balance of the capital expenditure is financed through an additional issue of share capital, part of the loan obtained from Murray VCT plc, Murray VCT 2 plc, and Murray VCT 3 plc and additional hire purchase facilities taken up. 44 Our cash position deteriorated by $0.5 million in FY 2001 mainly due to cash used in investing activities of $7.3 million, partially offset by cash generated from operations of $3.7 million and financing activities of $3.0 million. Cash generated from operating activities was mainly derived from profits from operations, coupled with a higher amount due to directors. The cash was used to part finance the capital expenditure of $8.0 million for new plants in Woodlands, Singapore and factories at Lancaster Road and Coronation Road in UK, which were also partly financed through bank loans and hire purchase arrangements. For the six months ended 31 October 2001, our cash position deteriorated by $1.2 million due to repayment of hire-purchase creditors and bank loans of $1.8 million. The decrease was partially offset by $0.5 million cash generated from operations and $0.1 million cash generated from sale of fixed assets. As at 31 October 2001, we are in a net overdraft position of $2.9 million. We plan to increase our working capital to meet purchases and operating expenses requirements in anticipation of the longer revenue collection cycle. In the past, customers have been billed progressively for one-third of total contract price at each of the three stages where tool orders are placed, tools sent for testing and tools are accepted. Now most automotive clients are, however, changing their policy and moving towards a ten per cent. payment upon order confirmation and 90 per cent. payment upon acceptance of tools. In view of this, we need to retain sufficient cash to cover any temporary shortfall in revenue collection. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND DIVESTITURES Our major capital expenditures comprise machinery and equipment in our manufacturing sites; furniture & fittings and computers in our technical centres. The purchases of such fixed assets are financed internally mainly by funds generated from operations or through hire purchase financing and bank loans. The details for such expenditure for each of the past financial three years is appended below: FY 1999 FY 2000 FY 2001 Description $’000 $’000 $’000 Leasehold property & improvements 31 1,972 2,027 Machinery & equipment 570 3,950 5,535 Motor vehicles 229 124 75 Furniture & fittings/Computers, Office equipment 277 396 355 Total 1,107 6,442 7,992 In FY 2000, our Singapore subsidiary leased a property in Woodlands for a period of 30 years. Additional machines have also been purchased to expand the production capacity of our Group. In FY 2001, one of our UK subsidiaries leased a property at Lancaster Road, High Wycombe, UK. Leasehold improvements were also carried out to the two new properties at Woodlands, Singapore and Lancaster Road, High Wycombe. The Group also continued to purchase equipment to expand our production capacity. We expect to incur approximately $0.2 million to purchase computer systems for the expansion of the research and design centre at our Singapore Headquarters and another $0.5 million for the acquisition of new machines and equipment for our manufacturing facilities in Singapore. The capital expenditure of $0.7 million will be financed by hire purchase arrangements and internally generated funds. 45 We believe that the net proceeds of $1.8 million from this Placement together with our current net overdraft balance of approximately $2.9 million as at 31 October 2001 will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital resources requirement through FY 2002. In the past three financial years, we have disposed of assets with net book values of $0.7 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million for FY 1999, FY 2000 and FY 2001 respectively. These assets include CNC machines, milling and grinding machines, EDM and wire erosion machines which are being replaced by the more advanced and higher capacity models. INFLATION The countries in which we operate have not experienced any hyperinflation for the past three financial years. FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE Our reporting currency is S$.

TAXATION Under Singapore’s current taxation system, the income tax paid by our Company on the taxable income at the prevailing corporate tax rate of 24.5 per cent. is deemed to be paid by our shareholders. Where these profits are distributed as dividends to shareholders, the dividends received by the shareholders are net of the corporate income tax paid by our Company. Where the dividends are received by our Company from our subsidiary companies in the UK, through CAC, our Company is subject to the applicable corporate tax rate. Where the dividends are received by our Company from our subsidiary, CAC directly, a tax exemption applies pursuant to the double-taxation treaty Singapore has entered into with the UK. For more details on the tax considerations applicable in Singapore, please refer to pages 99 to 101 of this Prospectus. For more details on the tax considerations applicable in the UK, please refer to Appendix C on pages 194 and 195 of this Prospectus for details on UK Tax Regulations. 47 BUSINESS INDUSTRY OVERVIEW AND PROSPECTS Traditionally, mould tool manufacturing had been considered a skill-based industry which involved a hand skill artisan approach. Over the years, tooling projects have increased in size and engineering complexity. This called for a shift from the traditional approach to the adoption of sophisticated computer programmes and high speed machining techniques to produce quality products. Today, much of our industry consists of highly qualified technicians operating advanced machines in a computer aided engineering environment. Recognising this trend, we are taking the initiative to re-focus our activities and position ourselves as a specialist providing a comprehensive engineering service to our customers. Our expertise will be extended to integrate component conception, tool design and concurrently engineered prototyping techniques to offer the best value added service to customers. Relationship between Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) and Suppliers The relationship with manufacturers is evolving such that tool manufacturers are moving up the supply chain and cutting down the number of layers between them and the OEMs. In a traditional supply chain, the tier one suppliers contracting with the OEMs are the component manufacturers who will then sub-contract the project to the second tier moulders. In some instances, injection moulding companies may also contract directly with the OEMs at tier one level. Therefore, either the component manufacturers or moulders will engage various tool manufacturers for tool production depending on the size of the production batch. The term “tier one suppliers” typically refers to the manufacturers or agents that co-ordinate between OEMs and tool manufacturers. Our relationship with manufacturers has been fundamentally changed to ensure that our leading edge technology and experience is at the disposal of the OEMs or their major tier one suppliers. The diagram below illustrates the relationship. Specialist Engineering Supply Chain Original Equipment Manufacturers Component Manufacturers Moulders Tool Manufacturers Penton International Group e.g. Automotive manufacturers Tier one Tier two Tier three q q q q q Represents direct contract relationship with tier one and tier two suppliers. Represents informal communication and marketing to OEMs such as via visits to OEM plants and supplier audits conducted by OEM personnel. 48 Our revenue is mainly derived from the management of new engineering projects for automotive, computer and the electronics sectors. As such, the performance of these sectors will significantly affect our revenue and operating results. The automotive industry has a long product development cycle lasting for three to five years, from conception, to the marketing of a new model. As the automotive industry is characterised by rapidly evolving and complex engineering technology, many design changes will occur through the development cycle. The management of these changes offers further revenue opportunities. Apart from changes in turnover, our operating results will also be affected by changes in direct labour costs that cover remuneration to our design, tool room engineers, machinists and technicians. Our industr y supports the manufactur ing sectors of automotive, consumer electronics, telecommunications and computer-related products, which are also the sectors serviced by us. The growth of our industry would have an effect on the performance of these sectors which would in turn affect our performance. We set out below an overview and long term prospects of the respective industries in which our Group operates in. Please see details of our future plans on pages 72 and 73 under the section “Prospects and Future Plans” of this Prospectus. Plastics Industry The worldwide plastics mould tools industry is dependent on the demand for plastic components and parts from MNCs for their operations around the globe. The plastics industry is one of the largest manufacturing industries in the world as plastics play an indispensable role in a wide variety of markets ranging from packaging and building/construction to transportation; consumer products, furniture and furnishings; electrical/electronics components and others. The wide range of properties of plastics such as lightweight, durability and corrosion resistant offers cost savings, design flexibility and high performance at lower costs to manufacturers. Plastics will continue to fuel the future of transportation, electrical and industrial equipment, appliances, computers and peripherals.(Source: The Society of the Plastics Industry, http://www.socplas.org/industry). According to a UK Environment Agency report, the worldwide annual plastics consumption is 100 million tonnes and growing at four per cent. yearly. One third of the demand is used in the packaging industry, with construction, automotive and electronics industries also being major consumers. (Source: Plastics and Rubber Weekly, dated 18 May 2001). A positive trend for the plastic injection moulding industry is the inclination towards the use of polymers for motor vehicles in the automotive industry to help to satisfy the need for materials that will meet the challenge of balancing safety, cost and environmental requirements for the new millennium (Source: Plastics and Rubber Weekly, dated 10 September 1999). Modern cars need to be reliable, safe, attractive, fuel-efficient and with minimum emissions. Plastics are recognised as able to meet these often-conflicting demands. Both Daimler-Chrysler’s smart car and the new Volkswagen Beetle are examples of cars that rely heavily on plastics for the cars’ unique design and performance. Environmental requirements are becoming ever more important when designing cars. Due to the plastics’ lightweight, approximately 100 kg of plastics in a modern car has replaced 200 to 300 kg of traditional materials. This weight saving is estimated to reduce fuel consumption by 750 litres over a typical life span of 150,000 km. Further calculations suggest that this reduces oil consumption by 12 million tonnes and carbon dioxide emissions by 30 million tonnes per year throughout Western Europe. According to a newsletter by American Plastics Council dated January 2001, the use of polymers in automotive applications has risen from an average of approximately 60 pounds per vehicle in 1970 to more than 360 pounds today. Estimates show that in five years, the average plastics content per vehicle will approach 400 pounds. (Source: http: www.americanplastics council.org). 49 According to a press release issued by BRG Townsend, Inc. on 14 February 2001, the use of non- steel exterior panels for automotive vehicles is expected to grow from two per cent. of the global market on a weight basis in 2000 to nearly five per cent. of the total in 2005. The most rapid growth is expected to occur in Europe, followed by North America and Japan. As for China, BRG Townsend, Inc.’s new study, as quoted by Platt’s Commodity News dated 30 July 2001, projected consumption of thermoplastic and thermoset compounds in the country’s automotive industry would increase from 330,000 metric tonnes per year in 2000 to 815,000 metric tonnes per year in 10 years. Plastics are also increasingly the material of choice in the electrical and electronic (“E&E”) industry. According to a newsletter dated Summer 2001 published by the Association of Plastics Manufacturers of Europe, plastics made up 15 per cent. by weight of all electrical and electronic equipment in 1980 and had risen to 20 per cent. by 2000. Designers specify plastics because of their performance benefits and efficient use of resources such as weight reduction, miniaturisation, electrical and thermal insulation. In 2000, 13,574,000 tonnes of electrical and electronic goods were produced in Western Europe. These included 2,670,000 tonnes of plastics, an increase of over 25 per cent. since 1995. (Source: http://www.apme.org). Automotive Industry In the European automotive market, automotive manufacturers are expanding their capabilities and realising greater economies of scale by either entering into collaborations or merging to take control of smaller automotive companies. The industry consolidation enables vehicles with more common engineered components such as non-visible items like floor pans, transmission and engines to be produced at large volume. Due to the varied lifestyles and culture, to cater to the different consumer groups and to be cost efficient, automotive manufacturers are changing their production approach to build vehicles on common reuseable platforms i.e. to retain the bulk of the components, while varying certain body parts. (Source: online article dated March 1999, an interview with James C. Schroer of Ford published by OneSource Information Services, Inc.) Through this, vehicle manufacturers are able to improve flexibility between production lines, to shorten lead times and reduce investments needed to introduce new variant models. This strategy has enabled vehicle manufacturers to develop their own niche sectors and thus generate higher profit margins. Autopolis, a UK-based automotive strategic consulting firm, issued a statement following the terrorist attacks in the USA on 11 September 2001, as reported on 13 September 2001 on the website of http://www.autoindustry.co.uk, forecasting that the prospects for the world’s auto industry was unlikely to change in the medium term. It predicted that there may be jitters for a few weeks following 11 September 2001 with supply lines disrupted and sales in North America likely to drop and thereafter, volumes may be boosted with money being pumped into the world financial system. However, in the long term, the downward trends of the world’s auto industry in the last 12 months are likely to resume. On 28 September 2001, Autopolis provided an update on the forecasts of global sales of new motor vehicles on the same website. It forecasted that the global sales of new motor vehicles will drop by 3.3 per cent. from 2000 to 2001 and a further reduction of 7.5 per cent. from 2001 to 2002. Thereafter, it forecasted that sales would increase by 2.9 per cent. from 2002 to 2003 and will increase further by 4.6 per cent. from 2003 to 2004. IT and electronics industry In view of the slowing U.S. economy, as reported in the International Data Corp (“IDC”) website (http:// www.idc.com) dated 10 September 2001, IDC, a global IT market intelligence and advisory firm, predicted that the worldwide personal computer shipments are expected to decline by 1.6 per cent. in 2001. Annual growth of 6.9 per cent. and 13.1 per cent. is expected to be seen by the end of 2002 and 2003 respectively. On 11 October 2001, IDC reported in its website that the events of 11 September 2001 will impact on the IT industry’s revenue for the last quarter of 2001. However, IDC believed that over the next five quarters, worldwide IT users would spend US$100 billion more in 2002 than in 2001. According to IDC, IT spending is expected to increase four to six per cent. in the USA, six to seven per cent. in Western Europe and 10 per cent. to 12 per cent. in Asia Pacific by the third quarter of 2002. 50 G RO UP S TR UC TU RE A ND S HA RE HO LD IN G S O ur G ro up s tru ct ur e an d sh ar eh ol di ng s im m ed ia te ly af te r t he P la ce m en t w ill be a s fo llo w s: - Lo on g Ho n W a h Lo ng H on C he on g Lo ng H on M en g 6. 9% Ch ris to ph er Jo hn C ul ley 44 .0 % Ch an M un Ly e 5. 3% Ch ow Ko k Ke e 4. 1% G oh S oi k Pi ew 4. 1% Th e T.

CAC acquired the entire issued share capital of TTL from our Chairman, Mr Christopher John Culley, on 17 July 1996 following a share swap. Spurtrend Engineering Limited was incorporated on 6 February 1995 as a shelf company and was transferred to CAC from two unrelated individuals on 27 March 1995. On 17 July 1996, Spurtrend Engineering Ltd acquired the entire issued share capital of Vogue Moulds Limited (“Old Vogue”) from two unrelated individuals and Spurtrend Engineering Ltd changed its name to “Vogue Moulds Limited” (“Vogue”). Old Vogue, which was by then a shell company was renamed Spurtrend (No. 2) Limited (“Spurtrend”). Spurtrend is now dormant. On 17 October 1997, the entire issued share capital of Penton Tools Limited (“Penton”) was acquired by CAC from a group of unrelated shareholders to further expand the equipment base and enlarge the experienced workforce of the CAC group. On 1 May 1998, the business and part of the net tangible assets of TTL were transferred to Penton whilst the remaining net tangible assets were transferred to a newly incorporated company, Tool Teck (Wales) Limited (“Tool Teck”). Tool Teck had been incorporated on 9 December 1997 as a shelf company and the two subscriber shares were transferred to CAC on 28 April 1998. Following the transfer of all its assets, liabilities and business operations into Penton and Tool Teck, TTL then became a shell company and was removed from the Register of Companies of UK on 5 October 1999 at the request of the directors. 52 On 25 February 2000, CAC purchased a 25 per cent. interest in Atech Moulds Manufacturing Pte Ltd (“Atech”) for a cash consideration of $210,000 resulting in Atech becoming an associate company. Penton International Pte Ltd was incorporated on 8 April 2000 in Singapore and has been carrying on the business of an investment and holding company since its incorporation. On 30 March 2001, Penton International acquired Atech as a wholly owned subsidiary and pursuant to the Restructuring Exercise set out on page 32 of this Prospectus, Penton International acquired CAC as a wholly owned subsidiary. Following the Restructuring Exercise, Penton International has brought CAC, Tool Teck, Vogue, Penton, Atech and Spurtrend under one corporate umbrella as the Penton International Group with 2 manufacturing plants in the UK and 1 in Singapore. Our plants in the UK occupy a total floor space of approximately 60,500 sq. ft. and employ about 100 staff while our Singapore plant occupies a floor area of 13,918 sq. ft. and employs about 60 staff. We have increased our tooling capabilities to handle tooling projects comprising mould tools from the smaller intricate multi-cavity format of 100 kg to large mould tools of 35 tonnes for the automotive industry. Today, our Group consists of five UK subsidiaries, CAC, Penton, Tool Teck, Vogue, Spurtrend and one Singapore subsidiary, Atech. Our plants have been consolidated into two manufacturing plants in the UK and one in Singapore. History of our subsidiaries TTL was started by our Chairman, Mr Christopher John Culley in 1984. It established its first tooling facility of 4,000 sq. ft. near High Wycombe, an area which had developed into a centre for the tooling sector of the engineering industry in the UK, and operated with less than 10 staff. The setting up of a second facility in Bridgend, Wales in 1989 enabled TTL to maintain and service the expanding electronics and manufacturing industries in the Thames Valley corridor and South Wales. The South Wales region had became a major centre for the production of precision plastic components for the electronics industry in the UK. The subsequent relocation of our Bridgend facility to a larger unit of 11,840 sq. ft. increased its tool handling capacity from 3 tonnes to 12.5 tonnes. In order to stay ahead of competitors, TTL improved on conventional tooling techniques by developing a strategy of continual investment in technology and training, and employing advanced automated tooling techniques. The incorporation of high-tech tooling techniques enabled it to successfully draw large IT and electronics organisations such as IBM, Compaq and Sony into its client base. The addition of Vogue during the first phase of our expansion programme not only gave us a factory of 7,944 sq. ft. at Baker Street, High Wycombe but also the tooling expertise for manufacturing tools from 100 kg up to 2,000 kg. We expanded our expertise into two shot moulding and gas injection tooling. Penton has more than fifty years of tooling experience and is a specialist in the production of large tooling of up to 35,000 kg, particularly for the automotive sector. Penton was created out of a merger between the long established mould tool maker, F.N. Doig Limited, which was incorporated on 20 May 1945, and another tool making business, Cyril Smith Limited, in 1972. The newly formed company was named Penton Tools Limited. During the 1950s and 1960s, Penton (then known as F.N. Doig Limited) was a manufacturer of bottle crate tools and containers for the brewing and dairy industries before switching into the growing automotive market. The automotive industry has remained the major market of Penton ever since. For the past three years, Penton’s automotive clients have included Ford, Jaguar and Volvo. The acquisition of Penton brought us a 22,260 sq. ft. factory equipped with tooling capabilities and design expertise necessary to secure the high margin automotive sector. In March 1998, the High Wycombe facility of TTL was relocated into Penton’s facility at Coronation Road, High Wycombe, to enjoy the benefits of economies of scale. 53 From the commencement of our acquisition programme in 1996, we have enjoyed a period of growth through acquisitions and organic development. For example, our acquisition of Penton brought new customers from the automotive sector. Through the acquisition programme, we are able to reduce wastage in direct labour resources and reap economies of scale, in particular, payroll savings without incurring any significant loss in production capacity. Our turnover grew from $3 million in FY 1996 to $19.5 million in FY 1998. Our net profit escalated from less than $0.1 million in FY 1996 to $1.7 million in FY 1998. From May 1998 onwards, our Directors decided to consolidate the three plant operations of TTL, Vogue and Penton at High Wycombe into one location. With our plant operations streamlined into one location, we were able to cut down our direct labour costs and protect our profit margin during the economic crisis when the market for our products experienced contractions and price pressure. In 1998, we embarked on an expansion programme to enter into the Asian and North American markets. We desire to be a global toolmaker with the ability to provide a complete package in designing and developing identical tools for MNCs operating around the globe. In October 1999, Murray VCT plc, Murray VCT 2 plc and Murray VCT 3 plc, (the “Murray Johnstone Venture Capital Trusts”) which are private venture capital trust funds, invested £2 million into our Group for working capital requirements in order to fuel our expansion plans. The capital injection comprised partial equity of £600,000 in CAC and a loan stock of £1.4 million. The Murray Johnstone Venture Capital Trusts have on 11 September 2000 entered into an agreement to sell all of the shares held by them in the capital of CAC to eight individual private investors (the “Private Investors”). The sale and purchase was completed on 2 May 2001. The first step to penetrate the Asian market began with our strategic investment in a Singapore tool manufacturing company, Atech, in February 2000. Atech was incorporated on 1 November 1983 and began operations in late 1984 carrying out mainly sub-contract tooling jobs for medium-size mould tool makers in Singapore. Atech’s contributions to our proforma Group’s NTA for FY 1999, FY 2000 and FY 2001 was 3.6 per cent., 19.3 per cent. and 22.9 per cent. respectively. Its profit before tax contributions for the same periods from FY 1999 to FY 2001 were 2.2 per cent., 39.4 per cent. and 18.6 per cent. respectively. Through our acquisition of Atech as a wholly owned subsidiary, our markets have extended to the USA, UK, India and Mexico. In August 2000, Atech relocated from its Ang Mo Kio site to the Woodlands site and its plant size increased from 8,041sq. ft. to 13,918 sq. ft.. On 23 February 2000, we achieved a significant milestone in our history as Penton was awarded the BS EN ISO 9001:1994 certificate by the National Quality Assurance Limited of the UK in recognition of its quality management system in project management, design and manufacture of mould tools. On 24 July 2000, we leased another factory at Lancaster Road, High Wycombe to undertake some of the large tooling contracts from the manufacturing facility at Coronation Road which has been taken over by Vogue and used mainly for tool trial, small tool production and tool modification. This adds another 26,266 sq. ft. to our production area. The production activities were fully operational in February 2001. In our continuous efforts to penetrate the Asian market, we moved our headquarters from the UK to Singapore where we incorporated our company, Penton International Ltd (incorporated as Penton Tooling International Pte Ltd) on 8 April 2000 as an investment and holding company for the provision of corporate and management services as well as research and design services to our subsidiaries. Currently, we are in the process of transferring small tool production from UK to Singapore. In the first half of FY 2002, we consolidated two of our manufacturing facilities in the UK. Our Bridgend facilities in Wales were relocated to the larger manufacturing site at Coronation Road, England, to take advantage of potential cost savings arising from economies of scale. After the relocation, the manufacturing facilities housed both Tool Teck and Vogue. Some of our staff have been offered the opportunity to relocate, for which cost of relocation were borne by them. 54 BUSINESS We are principally engaged in the design and manufacture of plastic injection mould tools for a wide array of tooling applications. Our clients are mainly OEMs, component manufacturers and moulders based in the automotive, IT and electronics industries who place orders for mould tools with sizes ranging from 100 kg up to 35,000 kg. We combine an in-depth knowledge and experience gathered over fifty years of tool making with advanced manufacturing technologies in the field of plastic injection mould tools. Our tool making expertise gathered could be traced back to 1947 when Penton was first incorporated. The tools are manufactured from some of the most advanced machines housed in our manufacturing facilities in UK. Our high speed machining centres are able to cut and shape steel blocks at speed and feed rate of up to 38,000 rpm and 20 metre per minute respectively. The high cutting speed ensures that precision and surface finishing of the completed tools are not compromised. With our large CNC milling machines, we can machine blocks of steel of up to 25 tonnes which, at present, our Directors believe few companies in Europe and Asia are capable of. Besides the technology edge in machinery, we have built up a team of 35 technical engineers in our technical or CAD/CAM programming centre. Our technical engineers are equipped with distinct skills and knowledge in tool designing which enable them to meet customers’ expectations and turnaround modifications within a short time. With our technical expertise, we are able to design and manufacture tools for the production of large “thickwall” injection moulded frame components with high degree of dimensional accuracy and consistency in thickness. We are positioned to be a specialist engineering service provider to global OEMs and MNCs in component design and tool development. We are capable of offering a comprehensive service, integrating component and tool design with concurrently engineered prototyping techniques to shorten the product development cycle for our customers. The bulk of our operations are devoted to new tool manufacture, mainly carried out at our High Wycombe and Singapore plants. At our High Wycombe plant, we also cover mould tool modifications and have a mould tool trialing facility. Each new mould tool is a unique piece of specialist engineering that is required for producing an individual plastic part. Modifications to mould tools result from engineering changes to plastic component designs. Our manufacturing facilities produce a wide range of mould tools that cater for the production of plastic components used in various finished products such as automobiles, computer peripherals, electronic equipment and home appliances. All mould tools have a basic design in terms of the shape of the steel block, the cavity and core halves, the methods of injecting the plastic material and the ejecting of plastic components. This basic design is modified to produce various types of tools for different moulding processes. Examples of the range of tooling applications that we support, apart from the conventional injection tooling, are two shot tooling, thin wall tooling, laminate insert moulding, reaction injection moulding, compression tooling and gas injection moulding. Our key markets are the automotive and the IT and electronics industry. We design and manufacture mould tools for the production of vehicle body parts, computer hardware, home appliances and electronic products. The table below sets out the type of components or products and brands our mould tools support. 55 Market segments Automotive IT and electronics Components or Instrument panel Interior and Modem end-products exterior trim Instrument CPU bezel substrate Under-bonnet Keyboard Quarter lights Printers PCB Chassis Fire and intruder alarm equipment Television Vacuum cleaners Beverage dispensers Washing machines Refrigerators Mobile phones and pagers Shower products Product brands Ford Canon Jaguar Compaq Volvo IBM Rover Digital Nissan Epson Toyota Sony Proton Panasonic Whirlpool General Electric Gillette Hewlett Packard Automotive Market Our UK manufacturing facilities serve the European automotive market by supplying a range of tools for the production of vehicle body parts, namely, the interior and exterior trim, and under bonnet parts. Within the automotive market, we receive automotive orders from the passenger car and the commercial vehicle sectors. The automotive sector has remained the largest market of Penton over the past few years. In fact, automotive tool orders generated 64.3 per cent. of our total turnover for FY 2001. We contract directly with OEMs such as Ford, Toyota and Jaguar. We also supply a range of mould tools to component suppliers such as Visteon, Johnson Controls and Linpac Mouldings Witton to support the production of vehicle parts in the UK. In particular for the Jaguar “X-type” Class contract, we supplied more than 30 tools for producing automotive substrates, garnishes, bezel, fuse box and scuffs. Our manufacturing sites also produce large tools for commercial vehicles such as Volvo trucks. We have recently secured a contract with a tier 1 supplier to Proton in Malaysia. Technical support for the project is provided by our Company and Penton in the UK, whilst manufacturing of the mould tool is carried out by Atech. IT and Electronics Market Our UK manufacturing facilities design and manufacture tools for the production of computer products such as printer covers, CPU covers, data storage bezels, modems and keyboard casing. Within the IT market, our clientele includes international IT hardware manufacturers such as IBM, Compaq and Digital, with operations based in the UK. 56 Apart from supplying mould tools for the automotive and IT industry, we also manufacture tools for the production of electronic products and home appliances. Our range of tooling supports the manufacture of electronic/electrical products such as PCB Chassis, fire and intruder alarm equipment, kettles, vacuum cleaners, beverage dispensers, shower products and circuit breakers. Tool Teck Wales has served established household names such as Sony, Panasonic and Gillette. Our Singapore subsidiary, Atech manufactures mould tools for the production of computer-related products, home appliances, electrical products and telecommunication products. It will be developed as our local production base to support tool contracts from Europe. Atech’s market extends beyond Singapore to overseas markets such as North America, Europe and East Asia. It exports more than 40.0 per cent. of its tools to countries such as USA, India and the PRC where MNCs, such as General Electric Company (“GE”) and Whirlpool, locate some of their manufacturing operations. For the past few years, Atech has retained an on-going customer relationship with Fu Yu Manufacturing Ltd, a local plastic injection moulder serving mainly the IT sector, which generated about 11.5 per cent of our aggregate turnover for FY 2001. Tooling projects for the electronics sector usually support the manufacture of high voltage circuit breakers and control covers. Atech has been receiving orders from the GE group for its subsidiaries in Belgium, Spain and Germany. Atech also designs and manufactures tools to produce plastic components and casings for refrigerators, washing machines, beverage dispensers, mobile phones and pagers for the home appliances sector. Mould Tool Project The project workflow chart is set out as follows:- Sales Quotation and Confirmation Computer Aided Design Computer Aided Machining Project Planning Raw Materials Acquisition Inspection and Tool Assembly In-house Tool Trial Customer Approval and Actual Production Mould Tool Manufacture – High Speed CNC Machining – Spark erosion – Wire erosion – Polishing, Bench Fitting and Beeding q q 57 Sales Quotation and Confirmation A work order number is raised for each new job placed by the customer. This initiates a contract review to confirm cost, delivery and product specifications with the sales, design and production departments. Order acknowledgement is issued to the customer confirming specification, cost and delivery. Computer Aided Design We are able to receive from customers computer aided design models in native formats such as Catia, SRDC I-Deas, Unigraphics and Pro-Engineer or IGES format if these native formats are not available. The tool design is produced as a three dimensional computer generated solid model. Because of our active involvement in the project, engineering changes are often made to improve the component and this data is then sent back to our customers with all history files intact. Computer Aided Machining The solid tool model generated within our technical centre can either be routed to our CAM programmers who then send the electronic data to our high speed machining centres or to the Real Time Machining (“RTM”) machine systems in our production centres. The RTM machine systems are able to activate our high speed machining centres to cut and shape steel blocks and modify the pre- programmed cutter paths concurrently in the event that tool modifications are required by customers. Project Planning (a) Computer Aided Project Planning Upon receipt of an order, the project is loaded into our computerised shop loading system which can perform project scheduling, allocate resources and monitor machine usage for each project The shop loading system is updated on a daily basis and functions as a management system to monitor efficiency and to inform customers of progress on their projects. With the completion of our website and electronic production tracking system, customers will have the ability to track the progress of their projects in real time from anywhere in the world. Our electronic production tracking system will be linked to our website where customers can log on through a secured password to gain access to their tool projects’ status. (b) Engineering/Project Management Continuous input from the project management team is required throughout the tooling process to ensure the customer receives the best-engineered component for the market place within the shortest time possible. We are increasingly providing more technical advice at the development stage of the component and we intend to become a tier one supplier to the large MNCs whom we are currently servicing. Raw Materials Acquisition Acquisition of raw materials may take place at different stages of the design process from our list of preferred suppliers. Mould Tool Manufacture 1. High Speed CNC Machining Centre The electronic files received from the technical centres are downloaded directly into our machining centres. We employ advanced technology utilising high speed cutters to achieve accuracy and quality in our finishing, thereby minimising hand finishing and polishing. 2. CNC Spark Erosion We use a combination of CNC and conventional EDM to perform erosion and shaping of the die surface. This process involves the use of an electrode made from conductive material mainly copper and graphite, to define the die surface. The electrode is positioned close to the die surface and an electric current is passed into the die from the electrode. The sparks generated 58 by the electric current erodes the steel away by melting small particles of the steel, producing a die with machinable profiles and pockets. The copper electrode is immersed in dielectric oil to aid the transmission of the spark and to flush the molten particles away. 3. Wire Erosion This process cuts 3D shapes in all types of material and profiles. Steel or any other material is submerged in a de-ionised tank of water where a brass wire follows a pre-determined path discharging electricity to erode away the material. 4. Polishing, Bench Fitting and Bedding When the above machining has taken place the steel blocks go through a fitting and polishing process. The mould tool part lines and all the working surface areas of the mould tools are checked and fitted to ensure good alignment before assembly. The bedding task involves the matching of both core and cavity halves to prevent the leakage of the plastic material when injected into the mould tool. Special diamond compound is sometimes applied to mould tool parts during the cleaning and polishing process to achieve various standards of finishing, the highest being mirror finishing. Inspection and Tool Assembly Inspections of tool parts are performed by qualified tool engineers to ensure product conformance and consistency to design specifications. The form faces are checked for clean finish, and dimensional accuracy before the final tool assembly. CMM measuring instruments are used to scan the tool surface, this data is cross-referenced against the customer’s electronic data. In-house Tool Trial The assembled mould tool undergoes water, electrical and hydraulic circuitry testing, to prove the functional ability of the mould tool. The initial trial is generally carried out on site utilising one of our in-house injection moulding machines. The purpose of this is to demonstrate the functional ability and quality of the mould tool. The plastic injection moulding process begins by preheating plastic resin in a dehumidifier. The pre- heated resin is then poured into the heated chamber of the moulding machine to melt the resin into a liquid form. Subsequently, a ram moving at high speed will inject the molten resin, under high pressure, into the mould tool to fill up its cavities. The high pressure is maintained against the molten resin to allow the resin to solidify within the mould tool. The temperature of the mould tool is controlled by water flowing through channels near to the form surface of the mould tool. The hardened plastic parts are then pushed off the mould tool by an ejector system to either drop onto a conveyor system or to be collected by a robot gripper. Customer Approval and Actual Production The sample components generated, together with inspection data if required, are submitted to the customer for approval before commencing the actual production run. Facilities and Machinery Facilities We presently operate from two manufacturing sites in the UK and one in Singapore. Our two High Wycombe facilities, at Coronation Road and Lancaster Road, have a floor area of 22,420 sq. ft. and 26,266 sq. ft. respectively. They concentrate mainly on the production of tools for the automotive and electronics industries. The smaller factory has an additional training area where machines are installed for apprentice staff to gain hands-on experience on machine operation and tool shaping. Our Singapore plant is located at Woodlands and occupies a floor space of 13,918 sq. ft.. 59 The mould tool trialing facility was set up in February 2001 at Coronation Road, High Wycombe, that supports our customers by offering them a one-stop solution from mould tool design, manufacture, testing to mould trial. These facilities give us the ability to perform testing and first production runs for our customers. We believe that our customers will perceive this as a value-added service. In addition to our designing, tool trialing and tool manufacturing operations, these facilities also house our corporate executives, sales and marketing, accounts and administrative departments. Our Singapore headquarters, situated at International Business Park, Jurong, undertakes corporate finance activities as well as provides research and design services to our Group companies. Machines The purchase of machines is carried out based on our capital expenditure budget, revised annually according to our forecast turnover and the requirements of our operations. The frequency of machine tool purchase is mainly driven by the technological advancements in the industry. The selection of new machines takes into consideration factors such as:- l The types and complexity of tool contracts l Technological advancements in performance and productivity levels l Reduction in floor space usage with a more efficient working environment l Life expectancy of proposed machinery l Greater accuracy of machining to simplify assembly work and reduce lead-times l Level of personnel required to run the proposed resource l Level of revenue generated from present and proposed machinery A review of manufacturing methodologies is carried out once half-yearly to evaluate the present plant and the associated levels of productivity which are recorded to serve as reference for future investment needs. We have implemented a stringent policy for machine maintenance in line with our corporate philosophy as well as government guidelines to promote health and safety measures at our production site. Our plant manager is responsible for overseeing and monitoring maintenance activities which are carried out in accordance with our quality control procedures. The day-to-day maintenance of each section of machines is delegated to various groups of staff. Specifically, we conduct a half-yearly alignment check of our machines to ensure that a high level of machining accuracy is maintained. Due to the complexity of modern machine tools, repairing and servicing works are out-sourced to specific machine vendors in the event of breakdowns. To further minimise any adverse impact on our production and operating results, we have taken up insurance coverage for our factories, machinery, equipment as well as our products to protect our business against risks of loss due to accidents, natural calamities and r iots. In the event of breakdowns or damages to the above mentioned, our insurance policies are adequate in covering the full costs of replacements as well as the losses incurred during production downtime. 60 Production Capacity The annual production capacity and utilisation rate for our UK and Singapore plants for FY 2001 are as follows:- Production capacity Utilisation rate (in thousands) (in thousands) UK plants Singapore plant UK plants Singapore plant Manufacturing – Labour 121 115 94 92 (man-hours) (77.7%) (80.0%) CAD/CAM process 38 28 26.6 21 (machine hours) (70.0%) (75.0%) Production capacity Utilisation rate (in thousands) (in thousands) UK plants Singapore plant UK plants Singapore plant CNC Milling(1) 35 29 19.9 24 (machine hours) (56.9%) (82.8%) Note:- (1) The CNC milling machines at the UK facilities have a larger machining capacity than the CNC machines at the Singapore facilities. The machine hours stated relate to the CNC milling process on medium and large CNC machines for our UK operations and the smaller CNC machines for our Singapore operations. We reserved excess capacity to ensure the smooth running of the production activity in the event of any machine breakdowns. In future, we will continue to enlarge our machinery and equipment base to meet the needs of a growing operation. For the past three years, we have not encountered any environmental issues that may affect our utilisation of assets. QUALITY ASSURANCE Our UK subsidiary, Penton has been awarded the BS EN ISO 9001:1994 certificate by the National Quality Assurance Limited of the UK on 23 February 2000 in recognition of our achievement in establishing a quality management system for project management, design and manufacture of mould tools. Our quality goals are achieved through the three aspects of skills, systems and technology. We ensure that both the manufacturing and management teams are highly skilled in the tool making and design processes. The BS EN ISO 9001:1994 is an internationally recognised award that gives recognition to companies with well-structured policies and procedures for quality control and customer service. We have invested in CNC and CAD technology that is compatible with computerised customer specifications. Specifically, our quality control system consists of the following: Supplier evaluations Potential suppliers and vendors are required to be screened by our management to assess them on the basis of their reputation for quality, reliability and promptness of delivery. Suppliers who pass the screening will be accepted as our approved suppliers. 61 Incoming quality assurance All our production materials are delivered with accompanying certificates of conformity. These serve as guarantees for the materials’ quality requirements and conformance to specifications. In-process quality checks We conduct design review, verification and validation procedures at the appropriate stages throughout the design and production phase. Design reviews involve customers’ appraisal at different stages of completion. Feedback from customers for improvements and corrective actions are recorded in quality reports. A preliminary review is conducted on the general assembly drawing. The final mould tool design review is carried out upon the completion of the tool design. Outgoing inspection and testing The completed mould tool is pre-tested to assess its compliance to customers’ specifications, functionality and durability. Component sample inspection reports are compiled by an independent company which is a member of the Institute of Quality Assurance in UK or our own inspection team. Project Progress Control and Monitoring To meet project deadlines and to ensure operational efficiencies, we maintain a project tracking system to report on the status of individual tooling projects for our internal management as well as for clients’ review. Currently, we are developing an online system which customers can log on to a secured password protected website and view the status of tool orders currently in production. Data from sales quotations on tool specifications are first input into our shop loading system and updated to track progress. The system is able to perform scheduling, allocate resources and monitor machine usage for each project. Regular progress meetings are held to control the processes of design and production throughout the life of the project, making sure that production time is consistent with the shop loading schedule. Having a comprehensive quality management system, we are able to deliver quality services and products to satisfy our customers’ requirements. In the past, we have not encountered any major production difficulties or delays that substantially lowered our product quality or standard of work performed. STAFF TRAINING It is our philosophy to implement continuous training and skills upgrading in order to achieve our corporate objectives of operating with leading technology and optimising individual employee’s performance. We send our staff on various training courses ranging from quality system training, technical training to software programming. Our tool room engineers, and machinists are sent for external courses to enhance the skills in operating the respective machines. These courses cover spark erosion, wire erosion, CAM programming and real time machining. To keep pace with the rapid technological developments, our design engineers and CAM programmers are sent for regular software training to be knowledgeable and equipped in running the latest CAD/CAM design applications, such as, Unigraphics Solid Modelling, SDRC I-deas, Cartia (developed by IBM), Pro-engineer, Delcam PowerShape and PowerMill. For effective management of tooling projects, our planning and manufacturing team are trained to use and monitor tooling progress through a tracking system. 62 Qualified staff assigned to trainees are responsible for guiding and monitoring their performance, documenting it on a personnel checklist and machine training record. New staff have to undergo a four-year apprenticeship during which they are trained on the job and guided by senior staff. They receive annual performance appraisal at the end of each year for assessment on work standards, performance, communication and commitment. Strengths and weaknesses are highlighted and specific areas are identified for improvements which can be achieved through more training programmes. Staff training needs are continually monitored by directors or managers through the annual training review. Documentation of these training reviews and recommended training plans are compiled and kept with the administration department. Training courses are administered in accordance with the training plan and in-house training records maintained for each employee. Apart from the regular software and technical training courses, staff are required to attend professional seminars on technological trends in the industry and management skills where necessary. In addition, we educate our staff in production safety measures, for example, fork truck safety and materials handling. For the financial year ended 30 April 2001, our total staff training cost amounted to $100,719 which accounted for 2.3 per cent. of our profit before tax. MAJOR SUPPLIERS AND RAW MATERIALS The suppliers accounting for five per cent. or more of our purchases during each of the last three financial years are listed below. Contribution to Purchases Supplier For Purchases of FY 1999 FY 2000 FY 2001 % % % Crusteel Limited Steel 18.2 12.9 1.8 Intersteel (UK) Limited(1) Steel — 8.7 12.0 Dynisco Hot Runners Limited Hot runner systems 7.3 10.1 8.2 Tontar Enterprise Pte Ltd Mould base 5.4 5.3 2.6 Note: (1) Intersteel (UK) Limited is a large European steel supplier who is a newly approved supplier for our Group in FY 2000. Save as disclosed above, none of the other suppliers accounted for five per cent. or more of our aggregate purchases for the last three financial years ended 30 April 2001. All production materials are purchased from various suppliers which are selected on the basis of reliability, quality and prompt delivery. None of our Directors or substantial shareholders have an interest (direct or indirect) in the above- mentioned suppliers. 63 Raw Materials The choice of material used in the fabrication of mould tools is dependent on different factors such as the type of tool, tool life, tool size, production requirements and surface finish. A tool may be broken down into the following main component parts:- – Large cavity and core form blocks – Cavity and core bolsters – Tool bolster plates – Small form inserts – Slides and up & aways – Wear plates – Bought out items The primary production material, steel, comes in various grades differing in the composition of metal element such as sulphur, nickel and chromium. The different metal composition results in different degree of hardness, resistance to corrosion and conductivity. Occasionally, aluminium bronze and copper alloy materials are selected for specific applications in mould tools. For example, copper alloy material is used for inserts where high thermal conductivity is required as this material has approximately six times better conductivity than steel. Other ancillary parts purchased include hot runner systems, hydraulic cylinders, gas systems, and ejector pins. Raw material costs approximately about 29.5 per cent. of the total costs of sales for FY 2001. We purchase production materials from suppliers based in Europe for our UK manufacturing facilities and from local suppliers for our Singapore plant. In the past, we have not experienced any major fluctuations in raw material prices.

None of our Directors or substantial shareholders have an interest (direct or indirect) in the above- mentioned customers. SEASONALITY Our business is not subject to any significant seasonal fluctuations. MARKETING AND CREDIT TERMS Marketing Our marketing strategy is targeted at potential OEMs and component suppliers in the manufacturing industry who require full suite packages; or integrated design capabilities; and present significant volume growth opportunities. We are not only concerned with fostering and maintaining business relationships with existing clients but also to secure new clients. We intend to carry out our marketing efforts through active networking, referrals and repeat customers. We market our services through a direct sales force, consisting of nine sales personnel who are responsible for establishing links with potential clients. We arrange for visits to potential customers or meetings with OEM personnel to introduce our services through our in-house CD-ROM presentations. Clients with intentions to engage our tooling services may visit our manufacturing sites to survey and judge our production capabilities and technical expertise before deciding on our service. To further raise our profile, we promote our services through press releases in trade journals and company brochures. We incurred less than 1 per cent. of our total operating expenses per annum on advertising and publicity for the last three financial years from FY 1999 to FY 2001. We price our services on the basis of the amount of machine hours, labour hours and costs of raw materials and ancillary parts required to complete the whole tooling project. The basic time for each project is determined on factors such as labour cost, the type of equipment used, the time required for tool production and the raw materials for manufacturing the mould tools. Any additional costs incurred to perform modifications on components are charged on top of the basic price quotation. Credit Terms We provide our customers a credit term of between 30 and 60 days. We may, in certain cases, extend the credit terms granted to customers, subject to our management review of the nature of the delay, our relations with the customer, the transaction amount, as well as credit term granted by our suppliers. We are usually also granted a 30 to 60 days credit term by our suppliers. However, longer terms may be negotiated in instances when we are requested to extend credit terms for our customers. In the past, our customers have been billed progressively for one-third of total contract price at each of the three stages where tool orders are placed, tools sent for testing and tools are accepted. Now most automotive clients are, however, changing their policy and moving towards a 10 per cent. payment upon order confirmation and 90 per cent. payment upon acceptance of tools. We do not make general provision for doubtful debts. Specific provision is made as and when it is considered doubtful by our Directors, for example, when a customer is in financial difficulties. 65 NEW PRODUCTS/ACTIVITIES As part of our commitment to providing a “One-Stop Shop” solution and our drive towards “Tier one” supplier status, we are pursuing the following:- Component Design In June 1999, we undertook a joint project with Sollatek (UK) Limited to design the component parts such as cases for power supply units and supply the production tools from our Coronation Road facility. Sollatek (UK) Limited is a manufacturer of electronic products. Component design involves the early conceptualisation and layout of the internal parts, including the fixing points, of a product. This has enabled us to enter into partnership with our customers at an early stage and provide initial advice on the feasibility of tool specifications. Offering a component design service can ensure a more efficient flow of information through our production facilities. This will lead to shorter lead times for our customers. Upon the partial transfer of tool design services to our Singapore research and design centre at International Business Park, Jurong, our technical centres at the High Wycombe facilities will take on more engineering projects in the area of component design. Moulding We currently have four moulding machines, with clamp capacity ranging from 80 to 1,750 tonnes, which undertake tool trials. This comprises two smaller machines with clamp capacities of 80 and 320 tonnes and two Sandretto injection moulding machines with clamp capacities of 820 tonnes and 1,750 tonnes. All these machines are situated at our Coronation Road facility at High Wycombe. Concurrently Engineered Prototyping Techniques We have stepped up our prototyping techniques with the production of prototype injection mould tools for the initial tool trials before undertaking the actual production. A tool project can take between two weeks to 30 weeks to complete depending on the number of tools, the size of tools, the variations and modifications required. Rapid prototyping techniques reduce the tool development to as short as two weeks. The prototype tools produced provide assurance on the feasibility and performance of certain tool designs. This activity will give us a competitive advantage against our competitors. Regenesys™ Energy Storage System Since 1996, we have been working on a technology project relating to the storage of electrical energy, known as the Regenesys™ energy storage system (“Regenesys™ system”). The Regenesys™ system is based on a new energy storage technology, offering flexibility in its power and energy storage rating. It has high speed of response, supplies real and reactive power and is suitable for many different applications on a power system. The Regenesys™ system was the invention of National Power PLC, a global company operating power stations across the world. On 2 October 2000, National Power PLC was split into two separate companies - Innogy plc which is in the UK energy business and International Power plc which is an international power business. The Regenesys™ project has since come under the management of Regenesys Technologies Limited, a technology management company wholly owned by Innogy plc. The project is carried out in four phases, mainly development, pre-production and testing, production of the existing version and production of the larger version. For the past five years, we have been assisting as part of a specialist team of carefully selected companies. Right from the initial design and development stage, we have been supporting the manufacture and testing of tools for building the fuel cell used in the Regenesys™ system. We are currently in the second phase of the project. This stage involves commercial proving tests conducted on the regenerative fuel cells installed at appointed power stations in the UK. We are in the process of refining and modifying the tools in response to improvements and variations done on the fuel cells. As soon as its success and feasibility is proven, promotion and marketing of the Regenesys™ system to the industry will take off. Following six years of collaboration with National Power PLC, design works are being carried out on the tooling contracts for the Regenesys™ energy storage system. 66 Through this project, we have achieved major technological breakthroughs in complex injection and compression mould tools. High technology injection mould tools are used to create multifunctional frames while complex compression moulds tool are used in the production of electrode components. With our technologically advanced machines and technical expertise, we are capable of building tools for the production of large components to engineering levels of accuracy. CUSTOMER SERVICE We place a strong emphasis on quality customer service which we believe is a significant factor in our customer’s selection of us for their tooling service. Our operational philosophy promotes responsiveness to customers’ needs, flexibility and delivery accuracy. This has enabled us to attract customers and develop important relationships with them. We hope to position ourselves as an integral and strategic partner in business. With an advanced technical centre, we provide the technical input and guidance in developing mould tool designs during the pre-production period. During the production stage, customers can have access to information regarding work in progress and to raise modifications if necessary. Our policy of quality, service and commitment to customers goes through the whole of our organisation and is maintained at every level of our quality assurance policy. We have a continuous investment programme both in the aspects of a highly skilled workforce and up to date technologies in terms of our CAD/CAM programmes and high-speed machining facilities. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Our research and development activities are focused on the constant upgrading of our design and machining software (CAD/CAM), development of high pressure mould tooling, thin-wall tooling, high speed machining facility and prototyping technology. Our technical department, comprising 25 engineers as of 31 October 2001, conducts research activities to enhance the efficiency of our operations and the quality of our products. We are continually adopting new relevant technologies to meet the new and more demanding challenges in the industry. We have collaborated with software companies, technology companies and education and research institutions to capitalise on their knowledge and resources for our research programmes. Paleman Consortium We are collaborating with Delcam plc and several other mould tool manufacturers to develop a new CAD design system under the Paleman Consortium. Delcam plc is a leading developer and supplier for the 3D design manufacture and inspection of complex tools. Its CAM software packages, DUCT and PowerMill are rated highly by the mould tool market for the preparation and manufacture of mould tools, dies and components with complex geometry. The Paleman consortium was initiated in response to the need for shorter lead-time from design to manufacture of mould tools, flexibility in incorporating mould tool modifications and ability to manufacture complex mould tool designs with maximum accuracy. The primary goal is to deliver the Paleman design system by empowering the current PowerShape and PowerMill semi-automatic software with certain functions for creating multiple surfaces, tooling shut off surfaces, automatic offsets, fillets and trimming. The new system will have the ability to accept product designs in a range of CAD formats and programme machine cutter path and splitting procedures on these designs. We are mainly involved in the specification of user requirements, testing and evaluation of the final software. The Paleman project is financially supported by the UK Department of Trade and Industry, under the EUREKA European collaborative research and development scheme. The expenditure incurred was £60,000 for the 4-year period, from FY 1998 to FY 2001, for which we received a grant of 35 per cent.. Apart from the Paleman project mentioned above, we have also been constantly upgrading our tooling machines, prototyping techniques and software programmes through on-going evaluations and modifications. 67 In the past, our research and development expenditure was not separately assessed and accounted for owing to the fact the research activities are integrated into daily design operations. We view every new tool design as a product of our research efforts into new engineering and tooling techniques. In regard to that, we estimate the costs incurred on research activities to amount to 10.0 per cent. of the total payroll costs based on the time spent by our design engineers in research and development. In future, we intend to modify our accounting system to track research and development expenditure. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Our business is primarily in the design and manufacture of plastic injection mould tools for customers on a contract basis. The intellectual property rights in the tool designs are owned by customers. Our mould tool design services are fully paid for by our customers. Hence, we are not dependent on any and do not have any patents or licences, and intellectual property rights. COMPETITION Our core business activities are mould tool design and manufacture of plastic injection mould tools. The mould tool design and manufacturing industry is a derived-demand industry where demand for our services is driven by the demand for products produced by our customers. The plastic injection mould tool manufacturing industry is characterised by a few major companies and a large number of smaller entities.

Experienced and Proactive Management Team Our Executive Directors and officers possess extensive experience and knowledge in the tooling and engineering industry. Most of them have an average of 20 years experience in the plastic injection mould tool manufacturing industry. They have either been serving in our subsidiaries or working for reputable engineering and tooling firms prior to joining our Group. Their in-depth knowledge and technical expertise are vital for the continued growth and future development of our Group. They are responsible for steering our operations towards technological advancement and quality performance. Over the years, our business has grown through the strategic acquisition of mould tool manufacturers to enlarge production capacity and enhance tooling capabilities so as to cater to a more diversified client base. Our success and growth is largely attributed to the proactive approach and foresight of our management team in seeking potential plastic injection mould tool manufacturers to complement our existing tool operations. For the past few years, our Directors have successfully amalgamated and integrated various mould tool manufacturing operations to form a single comprehensive tooling business that is versatile in tooling projects for a wide range of mould tool size. The synergies created through merging the different entities have resulted in a growing operation with a global client base and an established reputation within the moulding industry. 69 Diversified Client Base We serve a diversified client base which manufactures a wide array of products for the automotive, IT and electronics industries. Our customers consist of vehicle manufacturers, computer hardware manufacturers and manufacturers of electronic products and home appliances. With our manufacturing facilities in the UK and Singapore, we are positioned to support our MNC customers with operations based in Europe and Asia. We pursue an expansion plan centering on the strategic acquisition of plastic injection mould tool manufacturers to complement our existing tool operations. The acquired entities brought into our Group an enlarged production capacity, new tooling technologies and enhanced technical expertise. These in turn facilitate the diversification of our tooling expertise to reach new industries and markets in different geographical regions. For instance, the acquisition of Penton gave us access to large tooling projects created in the automotive market. High and Consistent Standards of Product Quality Our products are manufactured to meet all specified quality requirements with the use of quality steel and components, and skilled workmanship that help to achieve low internal defect rates and low customer rejection rates. We adhere to the policy of accepting only steel materials that are accompanied by certificates of conformity. Durability and high quality are critical factors in customers’ purchasing decision in order for mould tool maintenance and machine down times to be minimised. In this aspect, we have been able to gain the confidence of customers in our ability to deliver high quality mould tools that last. Integrated Service Provider We offer a comprehensive service, integrating mould tool design operations and concurrent engineering capability with our core mould tool manufacturing activity. An integrated service provides customers with a more cost efficient and convenient alternative as it eliminates logistics problems related to the use of multiple suppliers at different locations. Having the design expertise and concurrent engineering capability enable us to tie up with potential customers earlier. Our mould tool designs are generated from an advanced CAD system, which includes Pro-engineer, Catia and Unigraphic programmes. The CAD programmes are capable of performing functions to determine the various tooling procedures to maximise functionality and durability. Good Project Management Skills Before the commencement of any tooling project, our project teams, consisting of representatives from the technical, programming and production centres, are responsible for setting out the sequence of workflow, the allocation of machine usage and materials, and schedules for tooling projects. In addition, we rely on a tracking system to aid management in the planning and review of machine usage and tooling processes for different tooling orders. It also serves as a form of feedback for the team during progress meetings. The initial planning stage, together with the support of the tracking system, enables tooling projects to be carried out in the most efficient and technically appropriate manner. Good project management skills are essential especially for clients in the automotive and IT and electronics sectors where the market trends are constantly evolving. Tooling orders are often subject to many modification requirements in order for products to remain comparable to market standards. Hence, tooling projects must be managed in phases with substantial allowances between them to accommodate changes in design and specifications. Barriers to Entry We operate in an industry that has high barriers to entry. Mould tool design and manufacturing activities are capital intensive operations that require significant investments in heavy machinery and high-end technological equipment. Experienced staff with specialised technical skills, such as mould tool designing, machine path programming, machining and assembly, are integral to our business. The high initial start-up costs and the limited supply of skilled personnel create barriers to entry for potential competitors. 70 GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS To-date, regulations have not materially affected the results of our business operations. Our products must comply with all relevant regulations, standards and requirements in their respective targeted geographical markets. The degree of regulation varies from country to country. A brief background of the plastics injection mould tool industry regulations in the UK and Singapore is summarised below:- United Kingdom In the UK, companies carrying on business in the industry may be required to obtain certain licences and comply with certain regulations, in order to protect against issues such as the misuse of data held in respect of employees and customers, the provision of credit to consumers, the disposal of waste, the operation of heavy goods vehicles and the health, safety and welfare at work of all employees. Our UK subsidiaries are registered under the Data Protection Act 1998 and the UK subsidiaries have implemented satisfactory procedures to either exempt themselves from and/or comply with the relevant regulations. Singapore In Singapore, all public sector projects require us to comply with certain national standards and requirements. Private projects may also stipulate that products comply with the national standards. In Singapore, the standards are set by the Productivity and Standards Board (“PSB”), which is the local authority that ensures compliance with consumer product safety requirements. Currently, our Company complies fully with the appropriate standards set by the PSB. Our Company intends to fully comply with the standards set by the PSB and any directions that may be given by the PSB to our Company from time to time. Our Singapore subsidiary is also registered with the Trade Development Board under the Regulation of Imports and Exports Regulations.

The impact of the events of the 11 September 2001 attack on the World Trade Centre in the USA which affected the global economy has also affected our financial performance for FY 2002. Nevertheless, barring any unforeseen circumstances, our Directors expect our Group to remain profitable. However, our Directors expect that our results for the current financial year will be substantially lower than for FY 2001. Please see details of industry prospects on pages 47 to 49 under the section “Industry Overview and Prospects” of this Prospectus. Future Plans Our business plans and strategies can be summarised as below:- Global Presence through Strategic Acquisitions We will continually seek for opportunities to acquire new tool manufacturing facilities in order to achieve the desired capacity level and relevant technical expertise in order to serve a larger customer base and handle a broader array of tooling applications. We are currently in discussion with a tool manufacturer in North America to explore the possibility of an acquisition to provide sales and marketing services and support with minimal new tool manufacturing. We will be looking for similar opportunities in the region. Acquisitions not only bring about economies of scale but also an expanded equipment base and enlarged workforce essential to cope with tool projects of increasing scale. For the purpose of financing our business expansion and to acquire new tool manufacturing facilities in North America or the region, we intend to set aside approximately $1.5 million of the net proceeds of the Placement for the expansion. Our core customers are MNCs with operations around the world. For instance, automotive manufacturers are moving towards the trend of developing and marketing a common vehicle model in different countries simultaneously. Given the fragmented tool industry, our customers have to place tool orders with different tool manufacturers in different countries. As a result, they incur unnecessary design and development costs that could have been avoided by engaging fewer tool manufacturers. Hence, OEMs and component manufacturers are requiring entire suites of tools that preferably come from a single source. To achieve product uniformity and cost efficiency, it would be wise to engage tool manufacturers with the ability to manufacture large suites of related tools on a timely basis and provide maintenance support for operations based in different countries. With extended facilities, we are more able to serve high-end customers such as these in the automotive industry. Enhancements to Manufacturing Facilities Currently, we operate tool trialing facilities at our UK plant in Coronation Road, High Wycombe. It is our intention to introduce similar tool trialing facilities at Atech, our Singapore plant. We will perform testing on mould tools used in the injection mould press range of 50 to 150 tonnes. We expect to spend approximately $0.3 million in FY 2002 on acquiring new machines and equipment for our manufacturing facilities in Singapore. This investment will be financed through hire purchase borrowing and internal funds. 73 Component Design We intend to be an integrated supplier to our customers by becoming a key element in their desire to reduce lead times. It is perceived that the market leaders for the future will be companies that can bring their products to the customers in the shortest time. Such trends are evident in the automotive, electronics and telecommunication industries. For instance, mobile phones are now being produced from concept to tool production in six months as compared to one year in the past. Similarly, automotive manufacturers are aiming to develop new models in one year as opposed to five years less than a decade ago. Companies with the ability to bring their products to the market in the shortest time will have a competitive advantage over their counterparts and gain a greater market share. With the above in mind, we will further develop our component design service to effectively meet customers’ desire for short lead times and design expertise during the initial product development. Our customers will produce the “A” surface (the visual surface of the product) through either their own design department or specialist design firms. Our design team will then engineer the “B” surface, which includes all internal parts and the fixing points. We are capable of carrying out this task as we can offer compatible computer aided design so that any modelling can be passed up and down the supply chain with all the history files intact. With an in-house component design service, the design and manufacture of tools can proceed in parallel with the design of components as we have control in the flow of data. By managing both component and tool designs, we can ascertain the feasibility and quality of the components being designed. This will serve to avoid any extension in manufacturing times owing to infeasible component designs. Currently, component design service is provided at our Coronation Road, High Wycombe facility for selected projects. In future, we plan to channel the technical expertise at our High Wycombe facility into component design and offer this service on all tooling projects. This capability will enable us to enter into relationships with OEMs and component manufacturers at an earlier stage and offer technical input during the research and development phase of the product. Research and Design Centre We have set up a research and design division at our new headquarters in Singapore to provide design support for our engineering projects all round the world. Our Singapore research and design division will serve as a training ground for developing a skilled pool of design engineers. This will free our UK design division to channel its resources into the more demanding area of component design. Through our research and design division in Singapore, we will bring the latest high speed CNC machining technologies, advanced CAD/CAM programmes into full commercial operations to Singapore. We believe our move is in line with Singapore’s goals of advancing the local and regional manufacturing sector towards a more technology-intensive operation. We have since secured four design projects. We expect to spend approximately $0.2 million from internally generated funds from our operations to acquire more CAD systems and workstations for the expansion of our research and design centre. 74 DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT AND STAFF DIRECTORS The Board of Directors is entrusted with the responsibility for the overall management of the Company.

In addition, as a performance bonus, Messrs Mark Glyn Duke, Mark James Harding and two other directors of Penton, namely Brain Alfred Deacon and Neale Vincent Fray (“Penton Directors”) are also entitled to participate in 10 per cent. of Penton’s profit before tax (less 10 per cent. of Penton’s net asset value) (the “Penton Bonus”), which shall be shared between the Penton Directors as follows:- (a) 85 per cent. of the Penton Bonus to be divided equally between them; and (b) the balance 15 per cent. of the Penton Bonus is to be distributed between the Penton Directors in such proportion as the managing director of Penton may determine, having regard to the performance of each of the Penton Directors. Each of these service agreements may be terminated by either party giving not less than six months’ notice in writing to the other, or by Penton Tools Limited by summary notice upon the occurrence of certain events, such as misconduct or a material breach of the appointee’s obligations. 84 Our subsidiaries had also previously entered into various letters of employment or employment agreements with certain Executive Officers. Such agreements typically provide, inter alia, for the remuneration and benefits payable to such Executive Officers, annual leave, grounds for termination and certain restrictive covenants. Besides the employment contracts for our Executive Officers, and the Service Agreements disclosed above, there are no other existing or proposed service agreements between our Company, our subsidiaries and any of our Directors or Executive Officers. Had the aforesaid Service Agreements between our Company, our subsidiaries and our Executive Directors been in effect for FY 2001, the aggregate remuneration (including CPF/NI contributions thereon and benefits) payable to the Executive Directors of our Company would have been $1,387,678 (approximately 25.5 per cent. of profit before tax and Directors’ remuneration) instead of $1,058,890 (approximately 19.5 per cent. of profit before tax and Directors’ remuneration) and our profit before tax for FY 2001 would have been $4,051,224 instead of $4,380,012. FOUNDER’S SHARE SCHEME Mr Christopher John Culley, our Chairman and Managing Director, has established a founder’s share scheme prior to the Placement for the benefit of employees and directors in the Group. The objective of the scheme is to provide an opportunity for our employees and directors to participate in the equity of our Company and to motivate employees to optimise their performance standards, dedication and efficiency. Under the scheme which is administered by Mr Culley, all 2,000,000 Shares comprised in the scheme have been transferred to an aggregate of 104 employees and directors of the Group on 13 December 2001. A nominal purchase consideration of S$1.00 was payable by each employee for all Shares granted to him or her under the scheme. THE PENTON SHARE OPTION SCHEME On 7 December 2001, our Company adopted a share option scheme, namely “The Penton Share Option Scheme” pursuant to which options to subscribe for not more than 7,257,913 Shares would be granted to directors and executives of the Group. The rules of the Penton Share Option Scheme are set out in Appendix A of this Prospectus. Options to subscribe for up to 7,257,913 Shares were granted to 11 directors and executives of the Group (“Executives”) at a nominal consideration of $1.00 for each option. All the options granted, subject to the terms of the scheme, may be exercised from 7 December 2001, being the date of grant, assuming the Executives continue to be employed by the Group. These Executives have undertaken not to exercise such options prior to the official date of our admission to the SGX Sesdaq. The scheme is administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to determine the terms and conditions of the grant of the options, including the price at which the options may be exercised. The options to subscribe for up to 7,257,913 Shares have been granted at a subscription price of $0.12 per Share , representing a discount of 41.5 per cent. to the Issue Price. These options, if fully exercised, would amount to approximately 8.6 per cent. of the post-flotation issued share capital of the Company. These options will be valid for five years from the date of grant. The scheme formalised our understanding that we had with the individual Executives during the acquisition of CAC by our Company in relation to their participation in the share capital of the Company and the price at which such participation would occur. These Executives had been granted options under the C.A.C. Tooling Holdings Limited Company Share Option Scheme 1998 and the C.A.C. Tooling Holdings Limited Share Option Plan 2000 (the “CAC Share Option Schemes”) to subscribe for up to 79,870 ordinary shares in the capital of CAC. Pursuant to our understanding with 85 these Executives during the acquisition of CAC by our Company, these Executives were to be granted options to subscribe for an equivalent number of Shares in the capital of our Company upon the termination of the CAC Share Option Schemes and our Company had on 9 July 2001 entered into a deed of exchange with each of the Executives to exchange his existing option in the CAC Share Option Schemes for a new option under the Penton Share Option Scheme. The CAC Share Option Schemes and the options granted under the CAC Share Option Schemes were terminated on 7 December 2001. The Compensation Committee had on 7 December 2001, in accordance with the terms of the Penton Share Option Scheme, granted to the following Directors, Executive Officers and three other executives of our Group options to subscribe for the number of Shares set out opposite their names at a subscription price of $0.12 per Share:- Number of Shares in respect of % of the total which options post-flotation were granted share capital(1) Name of Director/Executive Officer Christopher John Culley 2,389,308 2.83 Stephen Joseph Harris 2,142,980 2.54 John Egerton Claridge De Morgan 91,896 0.11 Mark Glyn Duke 459,482 0.54 Mark James Harding 459,482 0.54 Neale Vincent Fray 183,793 0.22 Brian Alfred Deacon 137,845 0.16 Christopher John Oliver 91,896 0.11 Name of other executives of our Group(2) Finn Anthony Ashford 1,071,490 1.27 Stephen King 91,896 0.11 Gilbert Thomson 137,845 0.16 Total Shares in respect of which options were granted 7,257,913 8.59 Note:- (1) Based on post-flotation issued share capital of 84,497,030 Shares and does not include the Unissued Reserved Shares and Shares issuable upon exercise of share options under the Penton International Ltd Share Option Scheme 2001. (2) These three executives are not related to any of our Directors and/or substantial shareholders. An option has been granted to Mr John Egerton Claridge De Morgan to subscribe for up to 91,896 Shares representing not exceeding 0.1 per cent. of the total post-flotation issued share capital of the Company. Our Directors are of the opinion that such number of Shares is insignificant and will not affect his independence of judgement in his decision-making or Audit Committee functions. These Executives are integral members of our management team. We recognize the importance of acknowledging contributions made by our executives and directors to our success and development and these options reward the Executives for their contributions over the years to the Group without increasing our fixed wage costs. 86 THE PENTON INTERNATIONAL LTD SHARE OPTION SCHEME 2001 Our Company has also adopted an employee share option scheme that will be implemented following the completion of the Placement. The scheme will provide an opportunity for employees and executive and non-executive directors to participate in our equity. The terms of the scheme are set out in at Appendix B of this Prospectus. The scheme conforms with the requirements as set out in Practice Note No. 9h of the SGX-ST Listing Manual. Purpose and Administration of the Scheme We recognize the importance of acknowledging contributions made by the Group’s employees and directors to our success and development. The scheme will serve to motivate employees and directors to optimize their performance standards, dedication and efficiency. The scheme is also a strong incentive to attract and recruit new employees with abilities and expertise that would promote our long-term growth and profitability. The scheme will be administered by the Compensation Committee which will determine the terms and conditions of the grant of options, including the price at which employees may exercise the options and the vesting periods which may be over and above the minimum vesting periods prescribed by the SGX-ST Listing Manual. Under the scheme, the Committee has the ability to grant options to present and future full-time employees and directors (whether executive or non-executive). Size of the Scheme The total number of shares to be issued under the scheme will not exceed 15 per cent. of the total issued share capital of the Company from time to time. With a significant portion of our issued share capital set aside for the scheme, we believe that our employees and directors will recognize that we are making a significant effort to reward them for their efforts and contributions by providing greater opportunities to enable them to participate in the equity of our company. The 15 per cent. scheme size is intended to accommodate the potential pool of participants arising from a broad base of eligible participants and to support the use of share options in our overall long- term compensation strategy. We are of the view that the size of the scheme of 15 per cent. of our issued share capital is reasonable, taking into account the share capital base of our Company, the potential larger pool of employees as our Group’s business expands and the grant of the options over the duration of the scheme. Implementing the scheme with the maximum amount of shares currently allowed under the rules of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST will enable us to maintain flexibility and remain competitive in the industry. Eligibility Full time employees of our Group and our Directors are eligible to participate in the scheme. Controlling shareholders (as defined in the SGX-ST Listing Manual) and associates (as defined in the SGX-ST Listing Manual) of controlling shareholders are not eligible to participate in the scheme. Mr Christopher John Culley, our Chairman and Managing Director, will not participate in the scheme. Participants in the Scheme (i) Participation of Executive Directors and full-time employees of our Group The extension of the scheme to Executive Directors and confirmed full-time employees allow for a fair and equitable system to reward executive employees who have made and who continue to make important contributions to our long-term growth. The scheme will also operate to attract, retain and provide incentives to its participants to higher standards of performance as well as encourage greater dedication and loyalty by enabling our Company to give recognition to past contributions and services as well as motivating participants generally to contribute towards the long term prosperity of our Group. 87 (ii) Participation of Non-Executive Directors Our non-executive Directors are in a position to provide valuable support, input and business contacts and to contribute their experience, knowledge and expertise, and/or to provide our Company and our Group with strategic or significant business alliances or opportunities. This category of persons comprises individuals from various disciplines with different working experience and backgrounds which we may tap for assistance in furthering the business interest of our Company and/or our Group. Currently, remuneration is by way of Directors’ fees to non- executive Directors (for their services as directors of a company), which is wholly in the form of cash. Although the level of their remuneration is in accordance with the level of remuneration paid to non-executive directors of other companies, by including our non-executive Directors for coverage in the scheme, our Company will have the flexibility to consider, in the future compensating non-executive Directors for their services in cash and in share options. Through the scheme, our Company may acknowledge and give recognition to the efforts, achievements and contributions made by such persons in a combination of cash and share options. Subscription Price Under the scheme, the subscription price of options granted under the scheme will be determined by the Compensation Committee, in its absolute discretion, and the Compensation Committee may grant options to participants at up to twenty percent (20 per cent.) discount to the market price of the Shares for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the relevant date of grant of the option. The subscription price, however, shall not be less than the par value of the Share. Where the options are granted at the then prevailing market price of the Shares, the options may be exercised not earlier than the first anniversary of the date on which the relevant option was granted. However, for options granted at a discount to the then prevailing market price, such options may only be exercised not earlier than the second anniversary of the date on which the relevant option was granted. The ability to offer options at a discount to the prevailing market price of the Shares may be utilized as a means to recognise participants for their outstanding performance as well as to motivate them to continue to excel and is an additional method available to us for compensating employees other than through salary, salary increments and cash bonuses. This would enable us to introduce an effective manner of motivating participants to maximize their performance, which we believe would in turn create better value for our shareholders. Because share options granted with a discount are also subject to a longer vesting period than those granted at the prevailing market price, holders of such options are encouraged to have a longer term view of the company, thereby promoting staff and employee retention and reinforcing their ties to us. Potential Cost to the Company of Granting Options under the Scheme The cost to the Company of granting options, with or without a discounted subscription price under the scheme, includes the following:- (a) the effect of the issue of new Shares upon the exercise of options on our net tangible asset per Share is accretive if the subscription price is above the net tangible asset per Share, but dilutive otherwise. The dilutive effect is even greater if the subscription price is at a discount to the market price; (b) the exercise of an option at a discount to the market price would translate into a reduction of the proceeds from the exercise of such option, as compared to the proceeds that we would have received from such exercise had the exercise been made at the prevailing market price of the Shares. Such reduction of the exercise proceeds would represent the monetary cost to the Company of granting options at a discount; and 88 (c) as the monetary cost of granting options at a discount is borne by us, our earnings would effectively be reduced by an amount corresponding to the reduced interest earnings that we would have received from the difference in proceeds from a subscription price with no discount versus the discounted subscription price. Such reduction would, accordingly, result in the dilution of our earnings per Share. It should be noted that any options granted for Shares in the Company (whether or not the subscription price is set at a discount to the market price of the Shares) would have a fair value at the time of grant. The fair value of an option is an estimate of the amount that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for the option on the grant date. Options are granted under the scheme at a nominal value of $1.00. Insofar as options are granted at a consideration which is less than their fair value, there will be a cost to us, the size of which will depend on whether the options are granted at market price or at a discount. Currently, Singapore financial accounting and reporting standards do not require companies to account for share-based awards granted to their employees, as opposed to the USA where it is required under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. However, share options have value because the option to buy a company’s shares for a fixed price during an extended future time period is a valuable right, even if there are restrictions attaching to such an option. If Singapore financial accounting and reporting standards are revised such that our Company is required to account for share-based awards granted to employees, the cost of granting options will affect our Company’s financial results. 89 PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS SHAREHOLDERS The shareholders of our Company and their respective direct shareholdings immediately before and after the Placement are set out below:- Before the Placement After the Placement Number of Number of Shares % Shares % Directors Christopher John Culley(1) 37,219,145 54.3 37,219,145 44.0 Stephen Joseph Harris(6) 60,000 0.1 60,000 0.1 Mark Glyn Duke(6) 60,000 0.1 60,000 0.1 Mark James Harding(6) 60,000 0.1 60,000 0.1 Executive Officers Brian Alfred Deacon(6) 60,000 0.1 60,000 0.1 Neale Vincent Fray(6) 60,000 0.1 60,000 0.1 Christopher John Oliver(6) 50,000 0.1 50,000 0.1 Loong Hon Wah(5) 1,950,000 2.8 1,950,000 2.3 Substantial Shareholders (5% or above) The Trustees of the T.T.

Pension Scheme (the “Scheme”) was established by a trust deed dated 22 February 1995 and is a small self-administered pension scheme of which Tool Teck Limited was the founder. Tool Teck Limited subsequently became a wholly owned subsidiary of CAC on 17 July 1996. The Trustees of the T.T. Pension Scheme are JLT Trustees Limited (formerly Burke Ford Trustees (Midlands) Limited), Mr Christopher John Culley and his wife, Sari Hanelle Culley, and the current beneficiaries of the Scheme are Mr Christopher John Culley and his wife, Sari Hanelle Culley. The amount of benefits that the Trustees may pay to beneficiaries under the T.T. Pension Scheme on their retirement is limited by and subject to the rules of the T.T. Pension Scheme and the rules of the UK Inland Revenue. Save as disclosed above, the Company is not owned directly or indirectly by another corporation, or any foreign government or other person of such controlling corporation. Save as disclosed in “Founder’s Share Scheme” on page 84 of this Prospectus, there has been no significant change in the percentage ownership held by any major shareholder during the past three years. Our Company is not aware of any arrangement, which may at a subsequent date, result in a change in control of our Company. To our best knowledge and belief, none of our substantial shareholders, Directors or members of our management, supervisory or administrative bodies individually intend to subscribe for more than five per cent. of our Placement Shares. MORATORIUM Currently, Mr Christopher John Culley has a 54.3 per cent. direct shareholdings interest and a 7.4 per cent indirect shareholding interest in our Company by way of his position as a trustee and beneficiary of the T.T.

Following the completion of the Placement, Mr Christopher John Culley will hold 37,219,145 Shares, representing 44.0 per cent. of direct interest in the enlarged post-flotation issued share capital of our Company. As evidence of his commitment to our Group, Mr Christopher John Culley has undertaken not to sell or transfer any part of his interest in our Company for a period of twelve months from the date of our admission to the Official List of the SGX Sesdaq and for a period of twelve months thereafter not to reduce his shareholdings to below 50 per cent. of his total post-flotation shareholding. Following the completion of the Placement, the T.T. Pension Scheme will have a 6.0 per cent. direct interest in the enlarged issued share capital of the Company. The Trustees of the T.T. Pension Scheme have also undertaken not to sell or transfer any part of its interest in our Company for a period of twelve months from the date of our admission to the Official List of the SGX Sesdaq and for a period of twelve months thereafter not to reduce its shareholdings to below 50 per cent. of its total post- flotation shareholding. To show their commitment to our Group, Loong Hon Wah and his brothers who in aggregate hold 5,850,000 Shares, representing approximately 6.9 per cent. of our Company’s enlarged issued share capital after the Placement, have each undertaken not to sell or transfer any part of their respective interests in our Company for a period of three months from the date of our admission to the Official List of the SGX Sesdaq. The private investors, who in aggregate hold 18,973,550 Shares, representing approximately 22.5 per cent. of our Company’s enlarged issued share capital after the Placement, have each undertaken not to sell or transfer any part of their respective interests in our Company for a period of three months from the date of our admission to the Official List of the SGX Sesdaq. 91 INTERESTED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND CONFLICT OF INTERESTS INTERESTED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Save as disclosed below and under “Restructuring Exercise” on page 32 of this Prospectus, no Director, substantial shareholder or Executive Officer was or is interested in any material transactions undertaken by our Group within the last three financial years ended 30 April 2001 and the six months ended 31 October 2001. Acquisition of Atech On 30 March 2001, our Company acquired 100 per cent. of the issued and paid up capital of Atech comprising a total of 466,667 ordinary shares of $1.00 each, with effect from 1 May 2000, for an aggregate purchase consideration of $840,000, from the vendor shareholders of Atech on a willing buyer and willing seller basis. The respective vendor shareholdings in Atech prior to the acquisition and the number of new ordinary shares issued from the Company are as follows:- No. of ordinary shares of No. of new ordinary shares $1.00 each in the capital of $1.00 each in the capital Name of Atech of the Company issued Loong Hon Wah 116,667 210,000 Long Hon Cheong 116,666 210,000 Long Hon Meng 116,667 210,000 CAC 116,667 — Total 466,667 630,000 The purchase consideration was based on the unaudited net assets of Atech as at 31 December 1999, after adjusting for CAC’s investment of $210,000 in Atech. The purchase consideration was satisfied by the issue of an aggregate of 630,000 new ordinary shares of $1.00 each to Loong Hon Wah, Long Hon Cheong and Long Hon Meng, and a cash consideration of $210,000 to CAC. Subsequent to this acquisition, Atech became our wholly owned subsidiary. Lease of Property from the Trustees of the T.T. Pension Scheme On 17 July 1996, Vogue Moulds Limited (then known as Spurtrend Engineering Limited) entered into an agreement with the Trustees of the T.T. Pension Scheme (the “Landlords”) to lease premises at Baker Street, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, HP11 2RX, United Kingdom for an annual rent of £40,000 for 15 years commencing on 17 July 1996. The premises had been used as a warehouse for production materials, work-in-progress and finished goods. The rental had translated to a sum of approximately £5 per sq. ft., which our Directors believed represented the market rate for rental of a factory of a similar size and in comparable location. On 2 March 2001, the Landlords entered into a contract to sell the premises at Baker Street to a third party purchaser, Deeter Electronics Limited, and the sale and purchase of the property was completed on 5 March 2001. Vogue Moulds Limited has moved to a bigger site at Cressex Industrial Estate, Coronation Road, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, HP12 3SZ. Deeter Electronics Limited is not a related party. 92 Non-Executive Directorship of Mr John De Morgan From 1985 until October 1997, Mr John De Morgan served as the Finance Director and Company Secretary of Penton Tools Limited. From 1 May 1998 to 31 October 2000, Mr John De Morgan, one of our independent directors, served as a non-executive director of CAC. As a non-executive director of CAC, Mr John De Morgan had received an annual salary of £10,000 from CAC and he was responsible for the corporate governance of our UK subsidiaries and was the representative director of the Murray Johnstone Venture Capital Trusts following their investment in CAC in 1999. He was not involved in the day-to-day operations of our UK subsidiaries. Mr John De Morgan resigned from his position in CAC on 31 October 2000. Deeds of Exchange On 9 July 2001, our Company entered into a deed of exchange with each of Messrs Christopher John Culley, Stephen Joseph Harris, John De Morgan, Mark Glyn Duke, Mark James Harding, Neale Vincent Fray, Brian Alfred Deacon and Christopher John Oliver and three other executives, namely Finn Anthony Ashford, Stephen King and Gilbert Thomson, in Penton Tools Limited (collectively, the “Executives”) for the exchange by each Executive of his existing option in the CAC Share Option Schemes for a new option under the Penton Share Option Scheme to subscribe for an equivalent number of shares in the capital of our Company. This formalised the understanding our Company had with these Executives during the acquisition of CAC by our Company. CONFLICT OF INTERESTS Save as disclosed under “Restructuring Exercise” on page 32 of this Prospectus and in “Interested Party Transactions” above:- (a) No Director, substantial shareholder or Executive Officer has any interest, direct or indirect, in any material transactions to which we or any of our subsidiaries was a party in the last three financial years ended 30 April 2001 and the six months ended 31 October 2001; (b) No Director, substantial shareholder or Executive Officer has any interest, direct or indirect, in any company carrying on the same business or carrying on a similar trade as our Group; and (c) No Director, substantial shareholder or Executive Officer has any interest, direct or indirect, in any enterprise or company that is our Group’s customer or supplier of goods or services. Review Procedures for Future Interested Party Transactions All future transactions with related parties shall comply with the requirements of the SGX-ST Listing Manual.

Save as disclosed above, the Directors are not aware of any existing material related party transactions. The Audit Committee will review all future interested party transactions (within the meaning of Chapter 9A of the SGX-ST Listing Manual and/or where the value of each transaction is in excess of five per cent. of the Group’s NTA ), if any, periodically to ensure that they are carried out at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms. In the event that a member of our Audit Committee is interested in any interested party transaction, he will abstain from reviewing that particular transaction. The Board of Directors will also ensure that all disclosure requirements on interested party transactions, including those required by prevailing legislation, the SGX-ST Listing Manual and accounting standards, are complied with.

This description is only a summary and is qualified by reference to Singapore law and our Articles of Association. Ordinary Shares Our authorised capital is $18,000,000 consisting of 150,000,000 ordinary shares of par value $0.12 each. We have only one class of shares, namely, our ordinary shares, which have identical rights in all respects and rank equally with one another. Our Articles of Association provide that we may issue shares of a different class with preferential, deferred, qualified or other special rights, privileges or conditions as our Board of Directors may determine and may issue preference shares which are, or at our option are, liable to be redeemed, subject to certain limitations. Our Directors may issue shares at a premium. If shares are issued at a premium, a sum equal to the aggregate amount or value of the premium will, subject to certain exceptions, be transferred to a share premium account. As of the date of this Prospectus, 68,497,030 ordinary shares of par value $0.12 each are issued and paid-up. All of our Shares are in registered form. We may, subject to the provisions of the Act and the rules of the SGX-ST, purchase our own Shares. However, we may not, except in circumstances permitted by the Act, grant any financial assistance for the acquisition or proposed acquisition of our own Shares. New Shares New Shares may only be issued with the prior approval of our shareholders in a general meeting of our shareholders. The approval, if granted, will lapse at the conclusion of the annual general meeting following the date on which the approval was granted. Our shareholders have given us general authority to issue any remaining approved but unissued Shares prior to our next annual general meeting. Subject to the foregoing, the provisions of the Act and any special rights attached to any class of shares currently issued, all new Shares are under the control of our Board of Directors who may allot and issue the same with such rights and restrictions as it may think fit. Our shareholders are not entitled to pre-emptive rights under our Articles of Association or Singapore law. Shareholders Only persons who are registered in our register of shareholders and, in cases in which the person so registered is the CDP, the persons named as the depositors in the depository register maintained by the CDP for our Shares, are recognised as our shareholders. We will not, except as required by law, recognise any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any Share or other rights for any Share other than the absolute right thereto of the registered holder of the Share or of the person whose name is entered in the depository register for that Share. We may close the register of shareholders from time to time if we provide the Registrar of Companies and Businesses of Singapore with at least 14 days’ notice and the SGX-ST at least 10 clear market days’ notice. However, the register may not be closed for more than 30 days in aggregate in any calendar year. Transfer of Shares Save as disclosed in this Prospectus, there is no restriction on the transfer of our fully paid Shares except where required by law. Our Board of Directors may only decline to register any transfer of Shares which are not fully paid Shares or Shares on which we have a lien. Our Shares may be transferred by a duly signed instrument of transfer in any form acceptable to our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors may also decline to register any instrument of transfer unless, among other things, it has been duly stamped and is presented for registration together with the share certificate and such other evidence of title as they may require. We will replace lost or destroyed certificates for our Shares if we are properly notified and if the applicant pays a fee which will not exceed $1.00 and furnishes any evidence and indemnity that our Board of Directors may require. 95 General Meetings of Shareholders We are required to hold an annual general meeting every year. Our Board of Directors may convene an extraordinary general meeting whenever it thinks fit and must do so if shareholders representing not less than 10 per cent. of the total voting rights of all shareholders request in writing that such a meeting be held. In addition, two or more shareholders holding not less than 10 per cent. of our issued share capital may call a meeting. Unless otherwise required by Singapore law or by our Articles of Association, voting at general meetings is by ordinary resolution, requiring an affirmative vote of a simple majority of the votes cast at that meeting. An ordinary resolution suffices, for example, for the appointment of Directors. A special resolution, requiring the affirmative vote of at least 75 per cent. of the votes cast at the meeting, is necessary for certain matters under Singapore law, including the voluntary winding up of our Company, amendments to our Memorandum and Articles of Association, a change of our corporate name and a reduction in our share capital, share premium account or capital redemption reserve fund. We must give at least 21 days’ notice in writing for every general meeting convened for the purpose of passing a special resolution. Ordinary resolutions generally require at least 14 days’ notice in writing. The notice must be given to every shareholder who has supplied us with an address in Singapore for the giving of notices and must set forth the place, the day and the hour of the meeting and, in the case of special business, the general nature of that business. Voting Rights A shareholder is entitled to attend, speak and vote at any general meeting, in person or by proxy. A proxy need not be a shareholder. A person who holds Shares through the CDP book-entry clearance system will only be entitled to vote at a general meeting as a shareholder if his name appears on the depository register maintained by CDP 48 hours before the general meeting. Except as otherwise provided in our Articles of Association, two or more shareholders must be present in person or by proxy to constitute a quorum at any general meeting. Under our Articles of Association, on a show of hands, every shareholder present in person and each proxy shall have one vote and, on a poll, every shareholder present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for each Share held. A poll may be demanded in certain circumstances, including by the chairman of the meeting or by any shareholder present in person or by proxy and representing not less than 10 per cent. of the total voting rights of all shareholders having the right to attend and vote at the meeting or by any two shareholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote. Dividends We may, by ordinary resolution, declare dividends at a general meeting, but we may not pay dividends in excess of the amount recommended by our Board of Directors. Any dividend we pay must be paid out of our profits or pursuant to Section 69 of the Act. Our Directors may also declare an interim dividend. All dividends are paid pro rata among the shareholders in proportion to the amount paid upon each shareholder’s Shares, unless the rights attaching to an issue of any Share provides otherwise. Unless otherwise directed, dividends are paid by cheque or warrant sent through the post to each shareholder at his registered address. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our payment to the CDP of any dividend payable to a shareholder whose name is entered in the depository register shall, to the extent of payment made to the CDP, discharge us from any liability to that shareholder in respect of that payment. Bonus and Rights Issue Our Directors may, with the approval of our shareholders at a general meeting, capitalise any reserves or profits (including profit or monies carried and standing to any reserve or to the share premium account) and distribute the same as bonus shares credited as paid-up to our shareholders in proportion to their shareholdings. Our Directors may also issue rights to take up additional Shares to shareholders in proportion to their shareholdings. Such rights are subject to any conditions attached to such issue. 96 Takeovers The Act and the Singapore Code on Takeovers and Mergers regulate the acquisition of ordinary shares of public companies and contain certain provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a future takeover or change in control of our Company. Any person acquiring an interest, either acting singly or together with other parties acting in concert with him, in 25 per cent. or more of our voting shares must extend a takeover offer for the remaining voting shares in accordance with the provisions of the Singapore Code on Takeovers and Mergers. A mandatory takeover offer is also required to be made if a person holding, either on his own or together with parties acting in concert with him, between 25 per cent. and 50 per cent. of our voting shares acquires additional voting shares representing more than 3 per cent. of our voting shares in any 12-month period. “Parties acting in concert” include, unless the contrary is established, a company and its related and associated companies, a company and its directors (including their close relatives and related trusts), a company and any of its pension funds, a person and any investment company, unit trust or other fund whose investment such person manages on a discretionary basis, and a financial adviser and its client in respect of shares held by the financial adviser and shares held by all the funds which the financial adviser managers on a discretionary basis, where the shareholdings of the financial adviser and any of those funds in the client total 10 per cent. or more of the client’s equity share capital. Liquidation or Other Return of Capital If our Company is liquidated or in the event of any other return of capital, holders of our Shares will be entitled to participate in any surplus assets in proportion to their shareholdings, subject to any special rights attaching to any other class of shares then existing. Indemnity Our Articles of Association provide that, subject to the Act, we will indemnify our Directors and officers against any costs, charges, losses, expenses and liabilities incurred in the execution and discharge of their duties or in relation thereto. We may not indemnify Directors and officers against any liability which by law would otherwise attach to them in respect of any negligence, wilful default, breach of duty or breach of trust of which they may be guilty in relation to our Company. Limitations on Rights to Hold or Vote Shares Except as described in “Voting Rights” and “Takeovers” above, there are no limitations imposed by Singapore law or by our Articles of Association on the rights of non-resident shareholders to hold our Shares or to vote. Minority Rights The rights of minority shareholders of Singapore-incorporated companies are protected under Section 216 of the Act, which gives the Singapore courts a general power to make any order, upon application by any of our shareholders, as they think fit to remedy any of the following situations: l if our affairs are being conducted or the powers of our Board of Directors are being exercised in a manner oppressive to, or in disregard of the interests of, one or more of our shareholders; or l if we take an action, or threaten to take an action, or our shareholders pass a resolution, or propose to pass a resolution, which unfairly discriminates against, or is otherwise prejudicial to, one or more of our shareholders, including the applicant. 97 Singapore courts have wide discretion as to the relief they may grant and that relief is in no way limited to those listed in the Act itself. Without prejudice to the foregoing, Singapore courts may: l direct or prohibit any act or cancel or vary any transaction or resolution; l regulate our affairs in the future; l authorise civil proceedings to be brought in the name of, or on behalf of, our Company by a person or persons and on such terms as the court may direct; l provide for the purchase of a minority shareholder’s shares by our other shareholders or by our Company and, in the case of a purchase of shares by us, a corresponding reduction of our share capital; or l provide that our Company be wound up. 98 EXCHANGE CONTROLS There are no Singapore governmental laws, decrees, regulations or other legislation that may affect the following:- (a) the import or export of capital, including the availability of cash and cash equivalents for use by our Group; and (b) the remittance of dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of our Company’s securities. 99 TAXATION The discussion below is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of all tax consequences relating to ownership of our Shares. Prospective purchasers of our Shares should consult their own tax advisors concerning the consequences of their particular situations. This description is based on laws, regulations and interpretations now in effect and available as of the date of this Prospectus. The laws, regulations and interpretations, however, may change at any time, and any change could be retroactive to the date to the issuance of our Shares. These laws and regulations are also subject to various interpretations and the relevant tax authorities or the courts could later disagree with the explanations or conclusions set out below. Income Tax General Singapore resident taxpayers, which include individuals who are residing in Singapore and companies which are controlled or managed in Singapore, are subject to Singapore income tax on:- l income accruing in or derived from Singapore; and l foreign income received in Singapore. A corporate taxpayer is regarded as resident in Singapore if the company’s business is controlled and managed in Singapore (for example, if the board of directors meets and conducts the company’s business in Singapore). An individual is regarded as resident in Singapore if the individual is physically present in Singapore or exercises an employment in Singapore (other than as a director of a company) for 183 days or more in a calendar year, or if the individual resides in Singapore. Non-Singapore resident corporate taxpayers, subject to certain exceptions, are subject to Singapore income tax on:- l income that is accrued in or derived from Singapore; and l foreign income received in Singapore. Non-Singapore resident individuals, subject to certain exceptions, are subject to Singapore income tax only on income accruing in or derived from Singapore. The corporate tax rate in Singapore is 24.5% with effect from the year of assessment 2002 (i.e. financial year ended in 2001). In addition, three-quarters of up to the first $10,000 of a company’s chargeable income, and one-half of up to the next $90,000 will be exempt from corporate tax with effect from the year of assessment 2002. The remaining chargeable income will be taxed at 24.5%. The tax exemption will not apply to Singapore dividends received by companies which will be taxed at 24.5%. Subject to any applicable tax treaty, non-Singapore resident taxpayers are subject to a withholding tax at the Singapore corporate tax rate on certain types of income derived from Singapore or generally 15% in the case of interest, royalty and rental of movable equipment. 100 Dividend distributions Under Singapore’s taxation system, the tax we pay at the prevailing corporate tax rate is deemed to be paid by our shareholders. Our shareholders receive dividends net of such tax. Our shareholders are taxed on the gross amount of dividends (that is, on the amount of net dividends plus an amount equal to the amount of gross dividends multiplied by the prevailing corporate tax rate). The tax we pay effectively becomes available to our shareholders as a tax credit to offset their Singapore income tax liability on the gross amount of dividends paid by us. Dividends on our Shares received by a Singapore resident individual will be liable to tax in Singapore. The rate of tax will vary according to the individual’s circumstances but is subject to a maximum rate of 26% with effect from the year of assessment 2002 (i.e. calendar year ending in 2001). The tax we pay can be set off as a tax credit against the individual’s income tax liability. Any excess tax credit will be refunded to the individual. Dividends on our Shares received by a Singapore resident company will be liable to tax in Singapore at the corporate income tax rate. In the absence of any expenses which may be deductible against the dividends, the Singapore resident company will not receive any tax refund from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, nor be required to pay a further tax, since tax has been deducted at the prevailing corporate tax rate. A non-resident shareholder is effectively taxed on dividends on our Shares at the corporate income tax rate. Thus, no further Singapore income tax will be imposed on the net dividends received by a non-resident holder of our Shares. Further, the non-resident shareholder which does not have a permanent establishment in Singapore and deductible expenses attributable to such dividend income will normally not receive any tax refund from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. Gains on disposal of the ordinary shares Singapore does not impose tax on capital gains. However, gains may be construed to be of an income nature and subject to tax if they arise from activities which the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore regards as the carrying on of a trade in Singapore. Any profits from the disposal of ordinary shares are not taxable in Singapore unless the seller is regarded as having derived gains of an income nature, in which case, the disposal profits would be taxable. Stamp duty No stamp duty is payable on the issue of new shares. Where existing ordinary shares are acquired in Singapore, stamp duty is payable on the instrument of transfer of the shares at the rate of $2.00 for every $1,000 market value of the shares. For share transfers executed during the period 13 October 2001 to 31 December 2001, the stamp duty payable is reduced to $1.40 for every $1,000 market value of the shares. The purchaser is liable for stamp duty, unless otherwise agreed. No stamp duty is payable if no instrument of transfer is executed or the instrument of transfer is executed outside Singapore. However, stamp duty may be payable if the instrument of transfer which is executed outside Singapore is received in Singapore. The above stamp duty is not applicable to electronic transfers of the ordinary shares through The Central Depository system. Estate duty Singapore estate duty is imposed on the value of most movable and immovable property situated in Singapore owned by individuals who are not domiciled in Singapore, subject to specific exemption limits. Singapore estate duty is imposed on the value of most immovable property situated in Singapore and on most movable property, wherever it may be, owned by individuals who are domiciled in Singapore, subject to specific exemption limits. Our Shares are considered to be movable property situated in Singapore. 101 Accordingly, our Shares held by an individual are subject to Singapore estate duty upon such individual’s death, whether or not such individual is domiciled in Singapore. Singapore estate duty is payable to the extent that the value of the ordinary shares aggregated with any other assets subject to Singapore estate duty exceeds $600,000. Unless other exemptions apply to the other assets, for example, the separate exemption limit for residential properties, any excess beyond $600,000 will be taxed at 5% on the first $12,000,000 of the individual’s Singapore chargeable assets and thereafter at 10%. Individuals should consult their own tax advisors regarding the Singapore estate duty consequences of their ownership of our Shares. 102 CLEARANCE AND SETTLEMENT Upon listing and quotation on the SGX Sesdaq, our Shares will be traded under the book-entry settlement system of the CDP, and all dealings in and transactions of our Shares through the SGX-ST will be effected in accordance with the terms and conditions for the operation of securities accounts with the CDP, as amended from time to time. Our Shares will be registered in the name of CDP or its nominee and held by CDP for and on behalf of persons who maintain, either directly or through depository agents, securities accounts with CDP. Persons named as direct securities account holders and depository agents in the depository register maintained by the CDP, rather than CDP itself, will be treated, under our Articles of Association and the Act, as members of Penton International Ltd in respect of the number of our Shares credited to their respective securities accounts. Persons holding our Shares in securities account with CDP may withdraw the number of Shares they own from the book-entry settlement system in the form of physical share certificates. Such share certificates will, however, not be valid for delivery pursuant to trades transacted on the SGX-ST, although they will be prima facie evidence of title and may be transferred in accordance with our Articles of Association. A fee of $10.00 for each withdrawal of 1,000 Shares or less and a fee of $25.00 for each withdrawal of more than 1,000 Shares is payable upon withdrawing our Shares from the book-entry settlement system and obtaining physical share certificates. In addition, a fee of $2.00 or such other amount as the Directors may decide, is payable to the share registrar for each share certificate issued and a stamp duty of $10.00 is also payable where our Shares are withdrawn in the name of the person withdrawing our Shares or $0.20 per $100.00 or part thereof of the last- transacted price where it is withdrawn in the name of a third party. Persons holding physical share certificates who wish to trade on the SGX Sesdaq must deposit with CDP their share certificates together with the duly executed and stamped instruments of transfer in favour of CDP, and have their respective securities accounts credited with the number of Shares deposited before they can effect the desired trades. A fee of $20.00 is payable upon the deposit of each instrument of transfer with CDP. A fee of $10.00 is also chargeable as stamp duty on each instrument of transfer. Transactions in our Shares under the book-entry settlement system will be reflected by the seller’s securities account being debited with the number of our Shares sold and the buyer’s securities account being credited with the number of our ordinary shares acquired. No transfer stamp duty is currently payable for the Shares that are settled on a book-entry basis. A Singapore clearing fee for trades in the Shares on the SGX-ST is payable at the rate of 0.05 per cent. of the transaction value, subject to a maximum of $100 per transaction. The clearing fee, instrument of transfer deposit fee and share withdrawal fee may be subject to Singapore Goods and Services Tax of 3 per cent.. Dealings of our Shares will be carried out in Singapore dollars and will be effected for settlement on CDP on a scripless basis. Settlement of trades on a normal “ready” basis on the SGX-ST generally takes place on the third Market Day following the transaction date. CDP holds securities on behalf of investors in securities accounts. An investor may open a direct account with CDP or a sub-account with any CDP depository agent. The CDP depository agent may be a member company of the SGX- ST, bank, merchant bank or trust company. 103 DIRECTORS’ REPORT 14 December 2001 The Shareholders Penton International Ltd 9 International Business Park #03-00 Texmaco Building Singapore 609915 Dear Sirs, This report has been prepared for inclusion in the prospectus dated 14 December 2001 (the “Prospectus”) in connection with the Placement by Penton International Ltd (the “Company”) in respect of 16,000,000 new ordinary shares of $0.12 each in the capital of the Company.

We have reviewed the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) as of and for the six months ended 31 October 2001 as set out on pages 105 and 106 of the Prospectus. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to issue a report on these financial statements based on our review. We conducted our review in accordance with the Singapore Standard on Auditing applicable to review engagements. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial information is free of material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provides less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Group set out on pages 105 and 106 of the Prospectus is not presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting policies normally adopted by the Group. Yours faithfully Arthur Andersen Certified Public Accountants Singapore Max Loh Khum Whai Partner-in-charge 105 UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 OCTOBER 2001 The Directors confirm that Group’s unaudited consolidated profit and loss account for the six months ended 31 October 2001 and the unaudited consolidated balance sheet as at 31 October 2001 set out below have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies consistent with those appearing in the Accountants’ Report, on pages 107 to 136 of the Prospectus.

THE GROUP (CONTINUED) For the accounts of subsidiaries in the Proforma Group not audited by us during the accounting periods covered by this report, we have made such adjustments as we considered necessary in order to present the accounts on a consistent and comparable basis. The financial statements of the companies in the Proforma Group were audited in accordance with applicable auditing standards in the countries in which they are incorporated. The financial statements of the companies incorporated in Singapore were audited in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing. The auditors’ reports on the financial statements of the companies within the Proforma Group for all the periods under review were not qualified. D. BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION The financial information set out in this report has been prepared on the basis that the Proforma Group structure had been in place throughout the periods covered by this report. It has been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies of the Proforma Group set out in Section L of this report and is based on the audited financial statements of the companies in the Proforma Group from 1 May 1998, or the respective dates of incorporation, whichever is later, to 30 April 2001. Where the reporting year-ends of a subsidiary was not co-terminous with the reporting year-end of the Proforma Group, we have used, on a consistent basis, the audited financial statements of this subsidiary drawn up to the different reporting year-ends, adjusted for any significant impact on the Proforma Group financial information presented. In arriving at the Proforma Group financial information, we have made such adjustments as we considered necessary in order to present the financial statements on a consistent and comparable basis, including notional adjustments to reflect the investments and share capital of the Company, as if the Proforma Group had existed during the periods. 111 E.

Unusual item During the financial year ended 30 April 1999, the Proforma Group carried out a rationalisation exercise to streamline its United Kingdom operation. In the opinion of the directors, this event is clearly distinct from the ordinary activities of the Proforma Group and is not expected to recur frequently or regularly and accordingly, has been classified as an unusual item. 113 F. NOTES TO THE STATEMENTS OF PROFORMA GROUP RESULTS (CONTINUED) 4. Taxation comprises: Year ended 30 April 1999 2000 2001 S$’000 S$’000 S$’000 Current tax 157 406 761 Deferred tax (215) 205 — Over provision of tax in respect of prior years (4) (54) (7) (62) 557 754 The taxation charge for the Proforma Group differs from the amount obtained by applying the applicable corporation income tax rate to the profit before taxation of the companies within the Proforma Group. This is mainly due to: a. Profits of certain subsidiaries which could not be offset against losses incurred by other subsidiaries. b. Potential deferred tax liabilities are not provided for as these liabilities are not expected to materialise in the foreseeable future. These relate to accelerated capital allowances for plant and machinery capitalised as fixed assets in the accounts of subsidiaries incorporated in the United Kingdom. The capital allowances claimed may give rise to a taxation charge if the plant and machinery are sold or otherwise disposed off in the future at a consideration in excess of their tax written down values. The amount of deferred tax liabilities not provided for at the end of the respective financial years are as follows: Year ended 30 April 1999 2000 2001 S$’000 S$’000 S$’000 Deferred tax liabilities not provided for 2,076 3,006 3,274 The statutory tax rate for the Singapore incorporated companies is 26% for financial year (“FY”) 1999, 25.5% for FY 2000 and 24.5% for FY 2001. The corporate statutory tax rate of Singapore has been reduced to 24.5% with effect from the year of assessment 2002 (i.e. FY 2001). In addition, three-quarters of up to the first $10,000 of a company’s chargeable income, and one-half of up to the next $90,000 will be exempt from corporate tax for the year of assessment 2002. The remaining chargeable income will be taxed at 24.5%. The tax exemption will not apply to Singapore dividends received by companies which will be taxed at 24.5%. 114 F. NOTES TO THE STATEMENTS OF PROFORMA GROUP RESULTS (CONTINUED) For companies coming within the charge of UK Corporation Tax, income tax is based on the level of taxable profits. Companies with taxable profits of less than £300,000 (S$ 805,000) (lower profits limit) pay tax at 21% for FY 1998 and 20% for FY 1999 and onwards. Companies with taxable profits exceeding £1,500,000 (S$4,024,000) (upper profits limit), pay tax at 31% for FY 1998, and 30% for FY 1999 and onwards. For companies with taxable profits of between £300,000 and £1,500,000, an additional system (“marginal relief”) applies which seeks to provide an average tax rate which is between the two ‘normal’ rates. With effect from FY2000, a new “starting rate” has been introduced. Where profits are less than £10,000 (S$27,000), the rate is 10%. Up to profits of £50,000, a further marginal relief system applies which takes the average tax rate up to 20%. Where an accounting period of a company straddles a tax financial year, the taxable profits are apportioned on a time basis for the purposes of calculating the tax liability. In performing this calculation, the upper and lower limits (above) are also proportionally reduced on a time basis. To prevent the fragmentation of a business into a number of “small” businesses to exploit the tax rate system, the “upper” and “lower” limits are again proportionally reduced if the company has any associates. The limits are divided by the number of non-dormant worldwide associates plus one. A 50% interest is necessary for a company to become an “associate” for tax purposes. 115 G. STATEMENT OF ADJUSTMENTS The following adjustments have been made to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Proforma Group for the respective financial years covered by this report: Year ended 30 April 1999 2000 2001 S$’000 S$’000 S$’000 Turnover From summation of audited financial statements 21,793 26,817 25,245 Elimination of turnover within Proforma Group (5,365) (4,362) (821) Effect of change in revenue recognition method of a subsidiary (Note 1) — 1,525 — Adjustment for provision for contract losses (Note 2) — (583) — Adjusted turnover as stated in the Statements of Proforma Group results 16,428 23,397 24,424 Profit before taxation From summation of audited financial statements 1,696 3,979 5,630 Elimination of intra-group dividends proposed within Proforma Group — — (1,250) Effect of change in revenue recognition method of a subsidiary (Note 1) — 457 — Adjustment for provision for contract losses (Note 2) — (1,023) — Adjusted profit before taxation as stated in the Statements of Proforma Group results 1,696 3,413 4,380 Taxation From summation of audited financial statements (62) 779 1,004 Elimination of intra-group dividends proposed within Proforma Group — — (250) Tax effect of change in revenue recognition method of a subsidiary (Note 1) — 84 — Adjustment for provision for contract losses (Note 2) — (306) — Adjusted taxation as stated in the Statements of Proforma Group results (62) 557 754 Note 1 This represents a proforma change in accounting policy of a subsidiary for the financial year ended 30 April 2000 for the recognition of project revenue and costs from the completion contract method to the percentage-of-completion method to be in line with the accounting policy adopted by the Proforma Group. The subsidiary changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition to the percentage-of-completion method during the financial year ended 30 April 2001. There have been no other changes in accounting policies which have a material impact on the Proforma Group’s results for the periods under review. Note 2 This relates to costs incurred on a contract whereby a subsidiary developed “thin-wall” moulding technology. The costs incurred were initially treated as development costs as the Proforma Group expected to benefit from such technical know-how. The directors are of the opinion that the “thin-wall” moulding technology developed by the subsidiary will produce future economic benefits in later accounting periods. However, no material contracts in relation to this technology have materialised at the date of this report. Accordingly, these costs have been treated as contract costs and charged to the profit and loss account. 116 H.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The significant accounting policies which have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial information of the Company and the Proforma Group are as follows: Basis of accounting The financial statements, expressed in Singapore dollars, are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention modified by the revaluation of certain fixed assets and Statements of Accounting Standard in Singapore so as to reflect the results, cash flows and financial position of the Company and the Proforma Group. Basis of consolidation The Proforma Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to the end of each financial year. The results of the subsidiaries are included in the Proforma Group financial statements on the basis that the Proforma Group had been in existence throughout the periods covered in this report. Significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. In the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries maintained in their respective recording currencies have been translated into Singapore dollars as follows: (a) assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates approximating those ruling at balance sheet date; (b) issued share capital and reserves brought forward are translated at historical exchange rates; and (c) all profit and loss items are translated at the average exchange rates for the year. Exchange differences arising from the above translation are taken to translation reserve in the consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill and negative goodwill on consolidation The difference between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the net assets of subsidiaries acquired represents goodwill or negative goodwill on consolidation. Goodwill and negative goodwill on consolidation is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation. Goodwill and negative goodwill on consolidation are amortised over its useful life of up to a maximum of 20 years according to the estimated future economic benefits and losses which are expected to flow to the Proforma Group. Subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated in the financial statements of the Company at cost. Provision is made where there is a decline in value that is other than temporary. Revenue recognition Revenue from projects is recognised as work progresses, using the percentage-of-completion method. The percentage-of-completion for a given project is determined after considering the relationship of value of work done to-date to total contract revenue for the project. Costs of projects include raw materials, direct labour and other project related expenses incurred during the project period. A project is considered complete when all significant identifiable costs attributable to the project have been incurred. Provision is made for any foreseeable losses as soon as they are known. 122 L. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) Revenue recognition (Continued) Revenue from sale of goods is recognised upon delivery of goods and acceptance by customers, net of discounts and returns. Fixed assets and depreciation Fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation. Fixed assets are depreciated using the straight-line method to write-off the cost over their estimated useful lives as follows: Rates Leasehold properties and improvements Over period of lease Plant and machinery 15% to 33.3% Motor vehicles 20% to 25% Fixtures, fittings, office equipment and computers 15% to 33% Quoted investments Quoted investments held on a long-term basis are stated at cost. Provision is made when there has been a decline other than temporary in the value of the investment. Dividend income is recorded gross on the date it is declared payable by the investee company. Hire purchase Where assets are financed by hire purchase agreements that give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are capitalised as if they had been purchased outright at the values equivalent to the present value of the total rental payable during the periods of the hire purchase and the corresponding hire purchase commitments are included under liabilities. The excess of the hire purchase payments over the recorded hire purchase obligations is treated as finance charges which are allocated over each hire purchase term to give a constant rate of interest on the outstanding balance at the end of each period. Taxation Income tax expense is determined on the basis of tax effect accounting, using the liability method and is applied to all significant timing differences. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised when their timing differences will not reverse for some considerable period. Deferred tax benefits are not recognised unless there is reasonable expectation of their realisation. Foreign currency transactions and balances The accounting records of the companies in the Proforma Group are maintained in their respective recording currencies. Transactions in foreign currencies during the year are recorded in the respective recording currencies using exchange rates approximating those prevailing on transaction dates. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated into the respective recording currencies at exchange rates approximating those ruling at that date. All resultant exchange gains and losses are dealt with through the profit and loss account. Development costs Development costs incurred on specific projects are capitalised when recoverability can be assessed with reasonable certainty. The amount capitalised is then amortised over 4 years in line with the expected increased in sales arising from the projects. 123 L. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) Segment reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Proforma Group that is engaged either in providing products or services within a particular economic environment (geographical segment), or in providing products or services (business segment), which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments. Segment information is presented in respect of the Proforma Group’s geographical and business segments. The primary format, geographical segments, is based on the Proforma Group’s management and internal reporting structure. Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis. Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items mainly comprise income- earning assets and revenue, interest-earning loans, borrowings and expenses, and corporate assets and expenses. Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one period. (i) Geographical Segments The Proforma Group operates in two principal geographical areas, Singapore and the United Kingdom. In presenting information on the basis of geographical segments, segment revenue is based on the geographical location of their manufacturing facilities. Segment assets are based on the geographical location of the assets. (ii) Business Segments The Proforma Group comprises the following main business segments: – Automotive – Information technology and electronics Other operations comprise sales revenue der ived from mould tools to produce plastic components for use in civil and defence aviation equipment, gardening products, crates and packaging, and general engineering. 124 M.

(1) If at any time the share capital is divided into different classes, the special rights attached to any class (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class) may, subject to the provisions of the Act, whether or not the Company is being wound up, only be made, varied or abrogated with the sanction of a Special Resolution passed at a separate General Meeting of the holders of shares of the class and to every such Special Resolution the provisions of Section 184 of the Act shall, with such adaptations as are necessary, apply. To every such separate General Meeting the provisions of these Articles relating to General Meetings shall mutatis mutandis apply; but so that the necessary quorum shall be two persons at least holding or representing by proxy or by attorney one-third of the issued shares of the class and that any holder of shares of the class present in person or by proxy or by attorney may demand a poll.

PROVIDED ALWAYS that where the necessary majority for such a special resolution is not obtained at the Meeting, consent in writing if obtained from the holders of three-fourths of the preference shares concerned within two months of the Meeting, shall be as valid and effectual as a special resolution carried at the Meeting. 21.

Shares of different classes shall not be comprised in the same instrument of transfer. The Company shall accept for registration transfers in the form approved by the Exchange. 22. The instrument of transfer of a share shall be signed by or on behalf of the transferor and the transferee and be witnessed, provided that an instrument of transfer in respect of which the transferee is the Depository shall not be ineffective by reason of it not being signed or witnessed for by or on behalf of the Depository. The transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the share until the name of the transferee is entered in the Register of Members. Qualifications Rights attached To certain Shares Variation Of rights 144 23. No share shall in any circumstances be transferred to any infant, bankrupt or person of unsound mind. 24.

If the Directors shall decline to register any such transfer of shares, they shall give to both the transferor and the transferee written notice of their refusal to register as required by the Act. (2) The Directors may decline to register any instrument of transfer unless:- (i) such fee not exceeding S$2 (or such other sum as may be approved by the Exchange from time to time) as the Directors may from time to time require, is paid to the Company in respect thereof; (ii) the instrument of transfer, duly stamped in accordance with any law for the time being in force relating to stamp duty, is deposited at the Office or at such other place (if any) as the Directors appoint accompanied by the certificates of the shares to which it relates, and such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer and, if the instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on his behalf, the authority of the person so to do; and (iii) the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of shares. 26. The Register of Members and the Depository Register may be closed at such times and for such period as the Directors may from time to time determine, provided always that the Registers shall not be closed for more than thirty days in the aggregate in any year. Provided Always that the Company shall give prior notice of such closure as may be required to the Exchange, stating the period and purpose or purposes for which the closure is made. 27. (1) Nothing in these Articles shall preclude the Directors from recognising a renunciation of the allotment of any share by the allottee in favour of some other person. (2) Neither the Company nor its Directors nor any of its Officers shall incur any liability for registering or acting upon a transfer of shares apparently made by sufficient parties, although the same may, by reason of any fraud or other cause not known to the Company or its Directors or other Officers, be legally inoperative or insufficient to pass the property in the shares proposed or professed to be transferred, and although the transfer may, as between the transferor and transferee, be liable to be set aside, and notwithstanding that the Company may have notice that such instrument of transfer was signed or executed and delivered by the transferor in blank as to the name of the transferee or the particulars of the shares transferred, or otherwise in defective manner. And in every such case, the person registered as transferee, his executors, administrators and assigns, alone Person under Disability Directors’ Power to Decline to Register Terms of Registration Of transfers Closing of Register Renunciation Of allotment Indemnity Against Wrongful Transfer 145 Sum due to Allotment Power to Differentiate Payment of Dividends Apportionment Of dividends Payment of Preference And interim Dividends shall be entitled to be recognised as the holder of such shares and the previous holder shall, so far as the Company is concerned, be deemed to have transferred his whole title thereto. 32. The Directors may from time to time make such calls as they think fit upon the Members in respect of any money unpaid on their shares (whether on account of the nominal value of the shares or by way of premium) and not by the terms of the issue thereof made payable at fixed times, and each Member shall (subject to receiving at least fourteen days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his shares. A call may be revoked or postponed as the Directors may determine. 33. A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Directors authorising the call was passed and may be made payable by instalments. 34. If a sum called in respect of a share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment thereof, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum due from the day appointed for payment thereof to the time of actual payment at such rate not exceeding ten per cent per annum as the Directors determine, but the Directors shall be at liberty to waive payment of such interest wholly or in part. 35. Any sum (whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium) which by the terms of issue and allotment of a share becomes payable upon allotment or at any fixed date shall for all purposes of these Articles be deemed to be a call duly made and payable on the date on which, by the terms of issue, the same becomes payable, and in case of non-payment all the relevant provisions of the Articles as to payment of interest and expenses, forfeiture or otherwise shall apply as if such sum had become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified. 36. The Directors may on the issue of shares differentiate between the holders as to the amount of calls to be paid and the times of payments. 129. The Directors may, with the sanction of the Company, by Ordinary Resolution declare dividends but (without prejudice to the powers of the Company to pay interest on share capital as hereinbefore provided) no dividend shall be payable except out of the profits of the Company. 130. Subject to the rights of holders of shares with special rights as to dividend (if any), all dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid on the shares in respect whereof the dividend is paid, but (for the purposes of this Article only) no amount paid on a share in advance of calls shall be treated as paid on the share. All dividends shall be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amount paid on the shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid, but if any share is issued on terms providing that it shall rank for dividend as from a particular date such shares shall rank for dividend accordingly. 131. Notwithstanding Article 130, if, and so far as in the opinion of the Directors, the profits of the Company justify such payments, the Directors may pay fixed preferential dividends on any express class of shares carrying a fixed preferential dividend expressed to be payable on a fixed date on the half-yearly or other dates (if any) prescribed for the payment thereof by the terms of issue of the shares, and subject thereto may also from time to time pay to the holders of any other class of shares interim dividends thereon of such amounts and on such dates as they may think fit. Calls on Shares Time when Made Interest on Calls 146 138. The Company may, upon the recommendation of the Directors, by Ordinary Resolution direct payment of a dividend in whole or in part by the distr ibution of specific assets and in particular of paid up shares or debentures of any other company or in any one or more of such ways, and the Directors shall give effect to such Resolution, and where any difficulty arises in regard to such distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think expedient and in particular may issue fractional certificates and fix the value for distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the footing of the value so fixed in order to adjust the rights of all parties and may vest any such specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Directors. 164. If the Company is wound up (whether the liquidation is voluntary, under supervision or by the Court) the Liquidator may, with the authority of a Special Resolution, divide among the Members in specie or kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company and whether or not the assets shall consist of property of one kind or shall consist of properties of different kinds and may for such purpose set such value as he deems fair upon any one or more class or classes of property to be divided as aforesaid and may determine how such division shall be carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The Liquidator may, with the like authority, vest the whole or any part of the assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of Members as the Liquidator with the like authority thinks fit, and the liquidation of the Company may be closed and the Company dissolved, but no Member shall be compelled to accept any shares or other securities in respect of which there is a liability.

(1) Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company shall in each year hold a General Meeting in addition to any other meetings in that year to be called the Annual General Meeting, and not more than fifteen months shall elapse between the date of one Annual General Meeting of the Company and that of the next.

(3) In the case of any General Meeting at which business other than routine business is to be transacted (special business), the notice shall specify the general nature of the special business, and if any resolution is to be proposed as a Special Resolution or as requiring special notice, the notice shall contain a statement to that effect. 64. All business shall be deemed special that is transacted at any Extraordinary General Meeting, and all that is transacted at an Annual General Meeting shall also be deemed special, with the exception of sanctioning a dividend, the consideration of the accounts and balance sheet and the reports of the Directors and Auditors, and any other documents required to be annexed to the balance sheet, electing Directors in place of those retiring by rotation or otherwise and the fixing of the Directors’ remuneration and the appointment and fixing of the remuneration of the Auditors or determining the manner in which such remuneration is to be fixed. Any notice of a meeting called to consider special business shall be accompanied by a statement regarding the effect of any proposed resolution in respect of such special business. 65. No business shall be transacted at any General Meeting unless a quorum is present at the time the meeting proceeds to business. Save as herein otherwise provided, two Members present in person shall form a quorum.

The Chairman may, with the consent of any Meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the Meeting), adjourn the Meeting from time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned Meeting except business which might lawfully have been transacted at the Meeting from which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for fourteen days or more, notice of the adjourned Meeting shall be given as in the case of the original Meeting. Save as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to be transacted at an adjourned Meeting. 70.

Provided always that no poll shall be demanded on the election of a Chairman or on a question of adjournment. Unless a poll is so demanded (and the demand is not withdrawn) a declaration by the Chairman that a resolution has been carried or carried unanimously or by a particular majority or lost and an entry to that effect in the minute book shall be conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of or against the resolution. A demand for a poll may be withdrawn.

If a poll is duly demanded (and the demand is not withdrawn) it shall be taken in such manner (including the use of ballot or voting papers or tickets) as the Chairman may direct and the result of a poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the Meeting at which the poll was demanded. The Chairman may, and if so requested shall, appoint scrutineers and may adjourn the Meeting to some place and time fixed by him for the purpose of declaring the result of the poll. 72. If any votes are counted which ought not to have been counted or might have been rejected, the error shall not vitiate the result of the voting unless it is pointed out at the same Meeting or at any adjournment thereof, and not in that case unless it shall in the opinion of the Chairman be of sufficient magnitude. 73. Subject to the Act and the requirements of the Exchange, in the case of equality of votes, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, the Chairman of the Meeting at which the show of hands takes place or at which the poll is demanded shall be entitled to a second or casting vote in addition to the votes to which he may be entitled as a Member or as proxy of a Member. 74. A poll demanded on any question shall be taken either immediately or at such subsequent time (not being more than thirty days from the date of the Meeting) and place as the Chairman may direct. No notice need be given of a poll not taken immediately. 75. The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of a Meeting for the transaction of any business, other than the question on which the poll has been demanded. Alteration of Capital 50. The Company in General Meeting may from time to time by Ordinary Resolution, whether all the shares for the time being authorised shall have been issued or all the shares for the time being issued shall have been fully called up or not, increase its capital by the creation of new shares of such amount as may be deemed expedient. 51. Subject to any special rights for the time being attached to any existing class of shares, the new shares shall be issued upon such terms and conditions and with such rights and privileges annexed thereto as the General Meeting resolving upon the creation thereof shall direct and if no direction be given as the Directors shall determine; subject to the provisions of these Articles and in particular (but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing) such shares may be issued with a preferential or qualified right to dividends and in the distribution of assets of the Company or otherwise. 52. (1) Subject to any direction to the contrary that may be given by the Company in General Meeting or except as permitted under the Exchange’s listing rules, all new shares shall before issue be offered to the Members in proportion, as nearly as the circumstances admit, to the amount of the existing shares to which they are entitled or hold. The offer shall be made by notice specifying the number of shares offered, and limiting a time within which the offer, if not accepted, will be deemed to be declined, and, after the expiration of that time, or on the receipt of an intimation from the person to whom the offer is made that he declines to accept the shares offered, the Directors may dispose of those shares in such manner as they think most beneficial to the Company. The Directors may likewise so dispose of any new shares which (by reason of the ratio which the new shares bear to shares held by persons entitled to an offer of new shares) cannot, in the opinion of the Directors, be conveniently offered under this Article. Taking a poll Votes counted in error Chairman’s Casting vote 150 (2) Notwithstanding Article 52(1) above but subject to the Act, the Directors shall not be required to offer any new shares to members to whom by reason of foreign securities laws such offers may not be made without registration of the shares or a prospectus or other document, but to sell the entitlements to the new shares on behalf of such Members in such manner as they think most beneficial to the Company. 53. Except so far as otherwise provided by the conditions of issue or by these Articles, any capital raised by the creation of new shares shall be considered part of the original ordinary capital of the Company and shall be subject to the provisions of these Articles with reference to allotments, payment of calls, lien, transfer, transmission, forfeiture and otherwise. 54. (1) The Company may by Ordinary Resolution:- (i) consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of larger amount than its existing shares; (ii) cancel any shares which, at the date of the passing of the Resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person or which have been forfeited and diminish the amount of its share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled; (iii) subdivide its shares or any of them into shares of a smaller amount than is fixed by the Memorandum of Association (subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the Act), provided always that in such subdivision the proportion between the amount paid and the amount (if any) unpaid on each reduced share shall be the same as it was in the case of the share from which the reduced share is derived; and (iv) subject to the provisions of these Articles and the Act, convert any class of shares into any other class of shares. (2) Subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the Company may authorise the Directors in General Meeting to purchase or otherwise acquire any of its issued ordinary shares on such terms as the Company may think fit and in the manner prescribed by the Act. All shares repurchased or otherwise reacquired by the Company shall be cancelled and the amount by which the Company’s issued share capital is diminished on the cancellation of the shares repurchased or otherwise reacquired shall be transferred to an account called the “Capital Redemption Reserve”. 55. The Company may by Special Resolution reduce its share capital, any capital redemption reserve fund or share premium account in any manner and subject to any incident authorised and consent required by law. BANK BORROWINGS AND WORKING CAPITAL 22. Except as disclosed in the Accountants’ Report and pages 29 and 30 of this Prospectus, there were no other borrowings or contingent liabilities that had arisen by reason of any guarantees given by our Company. 23. In the opinion of our Directors, no minimum amount must be raised by the issue of the Placement Shares in order to provide for the following items:- (i) the purchase price of any property purchased or to be purchased which is to be defrayed in whole or in part out of the proceeds from the issue of the Placement Shares; New shares Otherwise Subject to Provisions Of Articles Power to Consolidate, Cancel and Subdivide Shares Power to purchase or acquire its issued shares Power to reduce capital 151 (ii) any preliminary expenses payable by our Company, and any commission so payable to any person in consideration of his agreeing to subscribe for, or of his procuring or agreeing to procure subscriptions for, any Shares in our Company; (iii) the repayment of any money borrowed by our Company in respect of any of the foregoing matters; and (iv) working capital.

Such amount is proposed to be provided out of the proceeds of the Placement or, in the event the Placement is cancelled, out of the existing funds generated from our Company’s operations. The amount of preliminary expenses in connection with the incorporation of our Company was approximately $5,000 and has been paid by our Company.

For this purpose, any issue of options by the Company to subscribe for new Shares at less than the price as ascertained by reference to Rule 8 shall be deemed to amount to a variation in the issued share capital of the Company. 9.2 Notwithstanding the provisions of Rule 9.1, no such adjustment shall be made:- (i) if as a result, the Subscription Price shall fall below the nominal value of a Share and if such an adjustment would but for this paragraph (i) result in the Subscription Price being less than the nominal value of a Share, the Subscription Price payable shall be the nominal value of a share; (ii) if as a result, the number of Shares which a Participant shall be entitled to subscribe for pursuant to the exercise of Options granted to him shall be reduced; and (iii) unless the Committee after considering all relevant circumstances, considers it equitable to do so. 9.3 The issue of securities as consideration for or in connection with an acquisition by the Company or a private placement of securities will not be regarded as a circumstance requiring adjustment under the provisions of this Rule 9. Any increase in the issued share capital of the Company as a consequence of the exercise of the options issued from time to time by the Company entitling holders thereof to subscribe for new Shares in the capital of the Company (including the exercise of any Options granted pursuant to this Scheme) will also not be regarded as a circumstance requiring adjustment. In addition, the cancellation of issued shares purchased or acquired by the Company by way of a market purchase of such shares undertaken by the Company on the SGX during the period when a share purchase mandate granted by the Shareholders of the Company (including any renewal of such mandate) is in force shall not be regarded as a circumstance requiring adjustment. 9.4 The restriction of the number of Shares to be offered to an Employee or Eligible Director under Rule 4 shall not apply to the number of additional Shares or Options over additional Shares issued by virtue of any adjustment to the number of Shares or Options pursuant to this Rule 9. 9.5 Upon any adjustment required to be made pursuant to this Rule 9, the Company shall notify the Participant (or his duly appointed legal personal representative(s)) in writing and deliver to him (or his duly appointed legal personal representative(s)) the Subscription Price thereafter in effect and the nominal value, class and/or number of Shares thereafter to be issued on the exercise of the Option. Any adjustment shall take effect upon such written notification being given. 182 10. OPTION PERIOD 10.1 (a) An Option shall be exercisable during the relevant Option Period, in whole or in part (provided that an Option may be exercised in part only in respect of 1,000 Shares or any multiples thereof). Upon the expiry of the relevant Option Period, the corresponding Options shall immediately become null and void. (b) The exercise of an Option (including the time and manner of such exercise) shall be subject to and carried out in accordance with any guidelines that may from time to time be prescribed by the Committee. The Company further reserves the right to treat any exercise as invalid where it has reason to believe that such exercise would or may infringe any applicable laws, including (but not limited to) any applicable requirements of the SGX. 10.2 An Option shall, to the extent unexercised, immediately lapse and become null and void and a Participant shall have no claim against the Company:- 10.2.1 subject to Rules 10.3 and 10.4, in relation to an Employee, upon the Employee ceasing to be in full-time employment of the Company or its Subsidiaries or Associated Companies for any reason whatsoever or in relation to an Eligible Director, upon the ceasing of his appointment as an Eligible Director or upon the ceasing of his employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries or Associated Companies (whichever is the later); or 10.2.2 upon the bankruptcy of the Participant or the happening of any event which results in his being deprived of the legal and beneficial ownership of such Option; or 10.2.3 in the event of misconduct on the part of the Participant, as determined by the Committee in its discretion. For the purpose of Rule 10.2.1, a Participant shall be deemed to have ceased to be so employed as of the date the notice of termination of employment is tendered by or is given to him, unless such notice shall be withdrawn prior to its effective date. 10.3 If a Participant ceases to be employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries or Associated Companies by reason of his:- 10.3.1 ill health, injury or disability as certified by a medical practitioner approved by the Committee; 10.3.2 redundancy; 10.3.3 retirement at or after his statutory retirement age; or 10.3.4 retirement before that age with the consent of the Committee; or for any other reason approved in writing by the Committee, he may exercise any unexercised Options within the relevant Option Period. 10.4 If a Participant ceases to be employed by a Subsidiary or Associated Company:- 10.4.1 by reason of the Subsidiary or Associated Company by which he is principally employed ceasing to be a Group company or the undertaking or part of the undertaking of such Subsidiary or Associated Company being transferred otherwise than to another Group company; or 10.4.2 for any other reason, provided the Committee gives its consent in writing; he may at the discretion of the Committee exercise any unexercised Options within the relevant Option Period. 183 10.5 If a Participant dies and at the date of his death holds any unexercised Options, such Options may, at the discretion of the Committee, be exercised by the duly appointed legal personal representative(s) of the Participant at such other period as the Committee may determine. 11. EXERCISE OF OPTIONS, ALLOTMENT AND LISTING OF SHARES 11.1 An Option may be exercised, in whole or in part, (provided that an Option may be exercised in part only in respect of 1,000 Shares or any multiples thereof) by a Participant giving notice in writing to the Company in or substantially in the form set out in Schedule C, subject to such modification as the Committee may from time to time determine. Such notice must be accompanied by a remittance for the Aggregate Subscription Cost and any other documentation the Committee may require. An Option shall be deemed to be exercised upon the receipt by the Company of the said notice duly completed and the Aggregate Subscription Cost and any other documentation the Committee may require. All payments shall be made by cheque, cashiers’ order, bank draft made out in favour of the Company. 11.2 The Company shall, as soon as practicable after the exercise of an Option, allot and issue the relevant Shares and apply to the SGX and any other stock exchange on which the Shares are quoted, for permission to deal in and for quotation of such Shares. Shares which are allotted on the exercise of an Option by a Participant shall be issued in the name of CDP or its nominees for credit to the Participant’s securities accounts with CDP, or the Participant’s sub-account maintained with a Depository Agent (as the case may be) and shall, on allotment, be subject to the provisions of the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company. Subject to such consents or other required action of any competent authority under regulations or enactments for the time being in force as may be necessary and subject to compliance with the Rules of the Scheme, the Company shall within 10 Market Days after the exercise of the Option allot the Shares and within 5 Market Days from the date of such allotment, issue and despatch to CDP certificates in respect of the Shares by ordinary post (or such other mode as the Committee may deem fit). 11.3 Shares which are allotted on the exercise of an Option to a Participant who is not a Singapore citizen shall be issued in the name of CDP to be credited to a separate securities sub-account to be opened by that Participant with a Depository Agent appointed by that Participant which has been selected by the Company and shall, for so long as the Shares are beneficially owned by the Participant, remain so registered. Such securities sub-account shall be opened by that Participant solely for the purpose of transacting in Shares allotted to that Participant pursuant to the Scheme. All charges levied by the Depository Agent including transaction charges and all expenses incurred by the Depository Agent from time to time shall be borne by that Participant. Shares which are allotted on the exercise of an Option to a Participant who is a Singapore citizen shall be issued in the name of CDP to be credited to the direct securities account of that Participant. 11.4 Shares allotted and issued on exercise of an Option shall be subject to all the provisions of the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company, and shall rank pari passu in all respects with the then existing issued Shares in the capital of the Company, save for any dividends, rights, allotments or other distributions, the record date (“Record Date”) of which falls on or before the relevant exercise date of the Option. “Record Date” means the date as at the close of business on which Shareholders must be registered in order to participate in any dividends, rights, allotments or other distributions. 11.5 The Company shall keep available sufficient unissued Shares to satisfy the full exercise of all Options for the time being remaining capable of being exercised. 184 12. ALTERATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS TO THE SCHEME Any or all the provisions of the Scheme may be modified and/or altered at any time and from time to time by resolution of the Committee except that:- (i) no modification or alteration shall alter adversely the rights attaching to any Option granted prior to such modification or alteration except with the consent in writing of such number of Participants who, if they exercised their Options in full, would thereby become entitled to not less than three-quarters (3/4) in nominal amount of all the Shares which would fall to be issued and allotted upon the exercise in full of all Outstanding Options; (ii) the definitions of “Employee”, “Eligible Director”, “Participant” and “Subscription Price” and the provisions of Rules 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.4, 14 and this Rule 12 shall not be altered to the advantage of Participants except with the prior approval of Shareholders at a general meeting; and (iii) no modification or alteration shall be made without the prior approval of SGX or any other stock exchange on which the Shares are quoted or listed, and such other regulatory authorities as may be necessary. Written notice of any modification or alteration made in accordance with this Rule 12 shall be given to all Participants. 13. DURATION OF SCHEME 13.1 The Scheme shall continue to be in force at the discretion of the Committee, subject to a period of twenty (20) years commencing on the Adoption Date with an offer of Options in every financial year of the Company up to the tenth (10th) financial year commencing with the financial year in which the first Date of Grant in respect of an offer pursuant to Rule 6 occurs, provided always that the Scheme may continue beyond the above stipulated period with the approval of Shareholders by ordinary resolution at a general meeting and of any relevant authorities which may then be required. 13.2 The Scheme may be terminated at any time by the Committee or by resolution of the Shareholders at a general meeting subject to all other relevant approvals which may be required. 13.3 The termination or discontinuance or expiry of the Scheme shall be without prejudice to the rights accrued to Options which have been granted and accepted as provided in Rule 7, whether such Options have been exercised (whether fully or partially) or not. 14. TAKEOVER AND WINDING UP OF THE COMPANY 14.1 In the event of a takeover offer being made for the Company, Participants (including Participants holding Options which are then not exercisable pursuant to the provisions of Rule 10.1) holding Options as yet unexercised shall be entitled to exercise such Options in full or in part in the period commencing on the date on which such offer is made or, if such offer is conditional, the date on which the offer becomes or is declared unconditional, as the case may be, and ending on the earlier of:- 14.1.1 the expiry of six (6) months thereafter (unless prior to the expiry of such six-month period, at the recommendation of the offeror and with the approvals of the Committee and the SGX, such expiry date is extended to a later date (being a date falling not later than the date of expiry of the Option Period relating thereto)); or 14.1.2 the date of the expiry of the Option Period relating thereto, whereupon any Option then remaining unexercised shall lapse and be null and void. 185 Provided always that if during such period the offeror becomes entitled or bound to exercise the rights of compulsory acquisition of the Shares under Section 215 of the Act and, being entitled to do so, gives notice to the Participants that it intends to exercise such rights on a specified date, the Option shall remain exercisable by the Participants until the specified date or the expiry of the Option Period relating thereto, whichever is earlier. Any Option not so exercised by the said specified date shall lapse provided that the rights of acquisition or obligations to acquire stated in the notice shall have been exercised or performed, as the case may be. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Rule 14.1 shall not come into operation in the event that a take-over offer which is conditional does not or is not declared unconditional. 14.2 If under the Act the court sanctions a compromise or arrangement, proposed for the purposes of, or in connection with, a scheme for the reconstruction of the Company or its amalgamation with another company or companies, Participants (including Participants holding Options which are then not exercisable pursuant to the provisions of Rule 10.1) shall be entitled, subject to Rule 14.5 below, to exercise any Options then held by them during the period commencing on the date upon which the compromise or arrangement is sanctioned by the court and ending either on the expiry of 60 days thereafter or the date upon which the compromise or arrangement becomes effective, whichever is later (but not after the expiry of the Option Period relating thereto), whereupon any unexercised Option shall lapse and become null and void. 14.3 If an order or an effective resolution is passed for the winding up of the Company on the basis of its insolvency, all Options, to the extent unexercised, shall lapse and become null and void. 14.4 In the event of a Shareholders’ solvent voluntary winding up (other than for amalgamation or reconstruction), Participants (including Participants holding Options which are then not exercisable pursuant to the provisions of Rule 10.1) shall be entitled within 30 days of the passing of the resolution of such winding up (but not after the expiry of the Option Period relating thereto) to exercise in full any unexercised Option, after which such unexercised Option shall lapse and become null and void. 14.5 If in connection with the making of a general offer referred to in Rule 14.1 above or a scheme referred to in Rule 14.2 above or the winding up referred to in Rule 14.4 above, arrangements are made (which are confirmed in writing by the Auditors, acting only as experts and not arbitrators, to be fair and reasonable) for the compensation of the Participants, whether by the continuation of their Options or the payment of cash or the grant of other options or otherwise, a Participant holding an Option, which is not then exercisable, may not, at the discretion of the Committee, be permitted to exercise that Option as provided for in this Rule. 14.6 To the extent that an Option is not exercised within the periods referred to in this Rule 14, it shall lapse and become null and void. 15. LISTING OF SHARES Options under the Scheme will not be listed or quoted on the SGX or any other stock exchange on which the Shares may be listed or quoted until the Options are exercised in accordance with Rule 11 above, whereupon the Company will apply to the SGX (and/or other stock exchange on which the Shares may be listed or quoted) for the listing of and quotation for such Shares, and will use its best endeavours to obtain permission to deal in and for the listing of and quotation for such Shares. 16. VESTING PERIOD/MORATORIUM The Options may, at the discretion of the Committee, be vested partially over a number of years.

Companies coming within the charge to UK Corporation Tax, pay tax based upon the level of taxable profits. Companies with taxable profits of less than £300,000 (lower profits limit) paid tax at 24% for FY 1996 (i.e. 1 April 1996 to 31 March 1997), 21% for FY 1997 and FY 1998, and 20% from FY 1999. Companies with taxable profits exceeding £1,500,000 (upper profits limit) paid tax at 33% for FY 1996, 31% for FY 1997 and FY 1998, and 30% from FY 1999. Companies with taxable profits between £300,000 and £1,500,000, an additional system (“marginal relief”) applies which seeks to provide an average tax rate which is between the two ‘normal’ rates. With effect from FY 2000, a new “starting rate” of Corporation Tax has been introduced. Where profits are less than £10,000, the rate is 10%. For profits up to £50,000, a further marginal relief system applies which takes the average tax rate up to 20%. Where an accounting period of a company straddles a tax financial year, the taxable profits are apportioned on a time basis for the purposes of calculating the tax liability. In performing this calculation, the upper and lower limits (above) are also proportionally reduced on a time basis. Finally, to prevent the fragmentation of a business into a number of “small” businesses to exploit the tax rate system, the “upper” and “lower” limits are again proportionally reduced if the company has any associates. The limits are divided by the number of non-dormant worldwide associates plus one. A 50% interest is necessary for a company to become an “associate” for tax purposes. Payment of Tax Broadly, where a company is paying tax at the full 30% rate, it must pay its tax by instalments. Currently, the UK is in a transitional period and for the financial year ended 30 April 2001 the instalments would be as follows: 14 November 2000 18% of estimated liability (instalment) 14 February 2001 18% of estimated liability (instalment) 14 May 2001 18% of estimated liability (instalment) 14 August 2001 18% of estimated liability (instalment) 1 February 2002 28% of estimated liability (balancing payment) For the financial year ending 30 April 2002, the payment profile would be the same dates as above (one year on) but with amounts of four instalments of 22% each and 12% payable for the last instalment. From the financial year ended 30 April 2003, the payment profile will be 25% on each of the instalment payment dates only. Where a company does not pay tax at the full 30% rate, the tax payment date is 9 months after the financial year end (i.e. 1 February). 195 Tax losses Tax losses arising on trading activities can be used to offset other income (e.g. capital gains, rental income etc) in the year in which the loss arose. Surplus trading losses can be carried back one year against all profits, or can be carried forward indefinitely against future trading income. They can not be carried forward and used against non-trading income such as capital gains, certain interest income and overseas dividend income. Capital gains Capital gains are taxed along with other income at the normal corporate income tax rate (currently 30%). Capital losses can be used to offset other capital gains only, and surplus capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely. Withholding Tax There is no withholding tax on dividends paid from the UK. In addition, Advance Corporation Tax (which was effectively a prepayment of corporation tax on the payment of a dividend) was abolished on 6 April 1999. Withholding tax on interest and royalties is 20% and 22% respectively, although this is generally reduced under the respective double tax treaties. Foreign Exchange Differences Foreign exchange differences are taxable/deductible on an accruals basis and therefore at the end of each financial year, all non Sterling monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated at the prevailing rate. Differences on investments in subsidiaries are generally taken to reserves (and generally not taxable/deductible), whereas differences on debts are taken straight through the Profit and Loss account and are therefore taxable/deductible. There are provisions allowing an offset where foreign currency borrowing are used to finance an overseas subsidiary. Thin capitalisation There are no fixed safe harbour rates for debt-equity or interest cover which will guarantee a deduction for interest. The rule is that the level of the loan and the interest charged must be equivalent to what an independent third party would lend. However, as a rule of thumb, the UK Inland Revenue will generally (although they are not obliged to) accept a debt-equity ratio of 1:1 and interest cover of 3 times. Ratios in excess of these figures may still be acceptable, and would need to be argued on a case by case basis depending on the relevant facts. If a company is thinly capitalised, the excess interest over and above what a third party would lend is re-characterised as a non- deductible distribution (dividend). Transfer pricing The UK has recently entered into a self-assessment regime for companies. This requires companies to self-assess that all transfer prices between affiliated companies are equivalent to a market price. Companies are expected to have sufficient documentation to support their prices. “Prices” includes (but is not limited to) transfer prices for good and services, management charges, royalties and interest.</str>
