=====

Python Implementations of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) technologies:

* **Lesk algorithms**
  * Original Lesk (Lesk, 1986)
  * Adapted/Extended Lesk (Banerjee and Pederson, 2002/2003)
  * Simple Lesk (with definition, example(s) and hyper+hyponyms)
  * Cosine Lesk (use cosines to calculate overlaps instead of using raw counts)
* **Vector Space Models** (in progress)
  * LSI/LSA
  * Topic Models, LDA (Li et al. 2012)
  * NMF
* **Baselines**
  * Random sense
  * First NLTK sense
  * Highest lemma counts 

(**NOTE**: requires `NLTK`, goto http://nltk.org/install.html)

Usage
=====

```
$ cd pywsd/
$ ls
baseline.py   cosine.py   lesk.py   README.md   test_wsd.py
$ python
>>> from lesk import simple_lesk
>>> sent = 'I went to the bank to deposit my money'
>>> ambiguous = 'bank'
>>> answer = simple_lesk(sent, ambiguous)
>>> print answer
Synset('depository_financial_institution.n.01')
>>> print answer.definition
a financial institution that accepts deposits and channels the money into lending activities

```
