Militants groups operating outside the umbrella of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan could be involved in the suicide attack on Islamabad court, said Shahidullah Shahid, spokesman for the militant organization.
 
Speaking from undisclosed location, Shahid said that all the groups and offshoots linked with the TTP were obliged to follow the decision of the organization.
 
He said that foreign intelligence agencies, especially India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) might try to aggravate the situation. He said there were some local spy outfits who didn’t want negotiations to be successful.
 
Reposing full confidence in the committee representing the Taliban to broker peace talks, he said that the government should also express seriousness after the ceasefire announcement.
