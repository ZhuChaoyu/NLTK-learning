Sindh Senior Minister for Education Nisar Ahmed Khuhro has said that the talks being held between the government and Taliban will remain inconclusive and prove meaningless, as the menace of terrorism simply cannot be eliminated through negotiations.
 
“It is high time for decisive action against terrorists. The Taliban and all of their supporters should not be considered anything but enemies of the state,” Khuhro said during a press conference convened on Wednesday to officially announce former PML-Q MPA Bano Sagheer’s move to the PPP.
 
He said the recent spate of terror attacks, including Monday’s bomb and gun attack at a court in Islamabad, were testament to the government’s failure in ensuring proper security at important installations.
 
Khuhro said that any politician calling for military intervention can never garner public support.
 
“Military rule has never been a viable solution for Pakistan’s problems, as proven by the repercussions of the four martial laws the country has witnessed,” he stated.
