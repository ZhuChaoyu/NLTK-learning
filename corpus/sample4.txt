ISLAMABAD: President Pakistan Muslim League-Q, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain Wednesday said it is not the job of army but of the government to engage in peace negotiations with the militants.
 
He was talking to media persons at PIMS hospital after enquiring about the health of the injured of Monday’s attack on the F-8 Kutchery here.
 
“Holding negotiations is the government’s job and not the army’s,” he asserted, adding, the idea of having army’s representation in the government’s negotiating committee was not a good one.
 
Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain said the government has so far been unable to make a choice between holding talks with the militants and launching a full-scale military offensive.
 
He was amazed that the authorities have still not been able to ascertain the number of assailants who attacked the F-8 Kutchery attack.
