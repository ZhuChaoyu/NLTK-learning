ISLAMABAD: Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) Chief, Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman Thursday stressed that scope of the ongoing peace talks be broadened to cover all the armed groups present in Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA) along Afghan border.
 
Speaking on the Internal Security Policy from the floor of lower house of the parliament, Maulana Fazl said it is a travesty that the Taliban have been given a status of a state. “We have seen the consequence of engaging in dialogue with an organization in the shape of an incident in Islamabad”, he added.
 
He observed that not even a single recommendation of the National Security Committee had been incorporated into the proposed policy.
 
He said it was imperative to take the military leadership on board but added that on the contrary, ‘the army seems to have taken us into confidence’.
 
The JUI-F Chief said the whole nation has rejected war and shown agreement on the adoption of dialogue option. He said use of force always remains available as the last resort but the government was already trying to build consensus on this option.
 
He said if the Madressas were targeted, it would become clear that Pakistan Mulsim League-N was not pursuing its own policy but of the US.
