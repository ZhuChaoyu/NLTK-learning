ISLAMABAD: An explosion took place near Faizabad flyover shortly after General (retd) Pervez Musharraf passed through the same route to get shifted from AFIC to his farmhouse in Chak Shehzad.
According to police, Musharraf's convoy was the apparently target of the explosion. However, the former military ruler has been shifted safely to Chak Shehzad farmhouse, they said.
The police further said the bomb was planted in the drainage pipe at a distance of 300 meters away from Faizabad flyover in which half kilogram of explosive material was used.
The blast left one foot deep crater at the site of incident, the police added.
Musharraf has been shifted from AFIC to Chak Shahzad after three months. He was taken to hospital on January 02 as he suffered a "heart problem" when he was on his way to appear before the special court hearing treason case against him.
